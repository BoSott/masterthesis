\subsection{Discussion indices and forecasts}

localization of forecasts and so on.. why it is difficult to use SPEI, SPI and so on and others.. --> more data to operationalize is very important, even though it should not be the task of the SRCS --> high costs but a lot of trust in the communities and CBS is also working great.

“There has been little effort to align the spatiotemporal granularity of socioeconomic assessments with the granularity of weather or climate monitoring.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1161](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=1&annotation=QBTLFCXM))

“but questions related to coping capacities, migration, poverty, water supply, access to food and markets, or political conflict remain unanswered or are even decoupled from routine drought risk assessments” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1162](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=2&annotation=HE48ZWFA))

“The handbook of drought indicators (Svoboda et al. 2016) lists more than 50 drought indices.

However, the study was limited by the low security levels in Somalia that makes

Somalia led to the collapse of hydro-meteorological monitoring network

research vs. reality

other perspectives than process oriented -> 7-layer model self-critisism (resource, behavioral perspectives, + value and communication network design approaches)

“It is important to note that local indicators cannot be collected specifically for the FbF system by RCRC national societies.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=LRDPV2M7))

“Indeed, collecting data on local indicators would require from the national society a team of enumerators that work continually to collect and process that information in all places where the program could possibly trigger (e.g. collect food price information for every village market). This would have extensive cost implications and likely over-burden the national society staff and volunteers.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=2YIIK6ZY))

“As such, the inclusion of local indicators into an FbA trigger must involve assessing what indicators are relevant for the impacts the program is trying to anticipate and identify which of those indicators are already collected (e.g. the ministry of agriculture's food price bulletin) and are available at the time they would be needed to inform a possible trigger.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=7X3RFGVB))

“Thinking outside the box in terms of both hydro-meteorological and socio-economic indicators could be particularly useful” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 31](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=31&annotation=GNZJ3FR5))

\subsection{FbF, EAP and actions}


,“Climate information presented as early warnings are only as valuable as the actions that are taken in response to the information, even if the information is a perfect warning of future events.” ([Mariani et al., 2015, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/8THVVJVK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GYUFNK32?page=8&annotation=Y9DG5FSE))



%During the development of an \acrshort{eap} more and complex challenges need to be addressed such as the lack of coordination and integration between sectors, limited capacities on the ground to decide and react accordingly due to data and resource shortages as well as the reality that they often work in areas where they have to operate in a complex network of actors and conflicting interests.

% --> language is important. --> staggered trigger -> cannot call everything an action! There is a difference between small and large repsonsen etc.. especially in the perception of people
“We also found that the phrases we had been using to trigger action, Be Aware, Be Prepared and Take Action, were not driving the actions we had hoped. We used Take Action exclusively for high impact warnings, but we need people to be taking action for low and medium impact warnings too, if the impacts are to be mitigated. We have replaced these phrases with detailed impact information and linked our warnings to advice and guidance from our partner organisations.” ([Harrowsmith et al., 2020, p. 62](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QJ397Y54)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2GS362N5?page=62&annotation=KZK3TSK3))


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% trigger:
“Given the different layers of complexity with drought, different types of triggers may be required beyond what is often used in EAP development. For instance, unconventional triggers for FbA for drought could include metrics such as staple food prices, percentages of crop failure, and other elements of food security early warning systems.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=JZV26DPP))
% --> even the RCRC is still looking for good triggers -> maybe water levels are a good way -> reasoning for this study


\subsection{Citizen Science -> CBS and Tools}
This works follows the “general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=2&annotation=BTE2JFKV)) which is basically “community-based monitoring, which also explicitly focuses on the public ’s involvement in monitoring processes” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=2&annotation=K4URWWLV))

“Local citizens are seen as essential participants in collaborative environmental management because they can provide vital information about the area’s natural and sociopolitical systems as well as support for measures to address non–point source pollution” ([Koehler and Koontz, 2008, p. 143](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/2PKW9CYX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/YYG4JK3R?page=1&annotation=MV6JAERB))


“Furthermore it is an interesting communication tool in the light of science communication. Correspondingly water managers should be interested in participatory monitoring in the light of integrated water management.” ([Minkman, 2015, p. 199](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/ZKLE6CPT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/QMAPCSZG?page=199&annotation=GHI9KSDA))

% in comparison to sensor networks:
“It is suggested, based on literature, that water authorities might prefer MCS to wireless sensor networks, for its mobility, lower costs and scalability.” ([Minkman, 2015, p. 11](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/ZKLE6CPT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/QMAPCSZG?page=11&annotation=RM5PX55M))

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% water scarcity and rural water sources
“Community cultures, economies, and environments differ across countries and regions. These differences should be considered when designing hybrid management strategies, so that all actors can be appropriately enabled and the mechanism which is most effective for the given community can be identified.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=WV5DXV5I))

“On this basis, it is essential to expand research area to study the various threats from climate variability to rural drinking water safety, and then to develop corresponding measures to address those threats to water security.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=HCQHR7YR))

-> can change the way the water sector is funded: “With these data readily available, performance-related contracts that incentivize sustainable service delivery over short-term infrastructure investment can become the norm.” ([Thomson, 2021, p. 11](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UQLXVVYI)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/K9XBXPQD?page=11&annotation=JP9R4Y89))


“Our results indicate that using the phones to transmit more than just water quality data will likely improve the effectiveness and sustainability of this type of intervention.” ([Kumpel et al., 2015, p. 10846](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPM4C7RJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7VXVKEXK?page=1&annotation=4DJIADX2))

\subsection{Subsection 2}

application design 
“Citizen Science experiments have demonstrated that at least three issues must be addressed: commitment of people participating in data collection (were social component is key), the validation of data collected and sent by citizens and privacy concerns about the collection of personal information.” ([Alfonso and Jonoski, 2012, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/4W4Q8E6B)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/PU944FGI?page=6\&annotation=LZXCJDFB))

% thus nice in theory, but not useful in practice
% in regard to drought and water scarcity
% and while there is an extensive body of literature about these topics, the minor details are not of great interest to this work but the general conclusion, that physical, large scale drought or water scarcity indicators do not capture the required level of detail and impact that is needed to operationally act upon. Also, while the complexity of these concepts is due to the level of complexity of the surveyed phenomenon, its application and comparison is hindered. Thus a method to assess local impact, that builds and incorporates these concepts in a practically applicable manner is needed to adequately address this detrimental topic. 

% self surveying is generally not recommended:
“Indeed, collecting data on local indicators would require from the national society a team of enumerators that work continually to collect and process that information in all places where the program could possibly trigger (e.g. collect food price information for every village market). This would have extensive cost implications and likely over-burden the national society staff and volunteers.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=2YIIK6ZY))

“As such, the inclusion of local indicators into an FbA trigger must involve assessing what indicators are relevant for the impacts the program is trying to anticipate and identify which of those indicators are already collected (e.g. the ministry of agriculture's food price bulletin) and are available at the time they would be needed to inform a possible trigger.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=7X3RFGVB))


% --> thus - monthly review of users is necessary
“In a region where migration is one of the main coping mechanisms for drought, a targeted survey focusing on the early detection of migration movements would help mobilize the timely allocation of resources by humanitarian decision-makers or even the mitigation of drought impacts.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1167](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=7&annotation=N9FRDA9C))



% keeping data up to date is crucial in ensuring correct vulnerability and exposure data 
“Vulnerability and exposure changes over time, particularly after an extreme weather or climate event. Datasets must be kept up to date to ensure the impact-based forecast or warning using this data is reliable. Recognise that many official governmental data sources, such as a national census or demographic and health surveys, are updated infrequently – every five or ten years.” ([Harrowsmith et al., 2020, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QJ397Y54)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2GS362N5?page=28&annotation=5XVAQCTY))
