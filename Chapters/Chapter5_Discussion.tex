% justification as discussion is not really possible

This study aimed to design and test an approach for community-based participatory mapping and monitoring of water sources in a water-scarce and resource-limited setting in collaboration with the \acrlong{srcs}. The ultimate goal was to facilitate respective \acrlongpl{aa} in the context of \acrlong{fbf} and to improve water management and accessibility in underserved communities. To achieve this aim, four research objectives were formulated, including a comprehensive literature review to identify and evaluate principles for community-based participatory mapping and monitoring, assessing the feasibility of the approach in the given context, developing a replicable and adaptable framework based on the identified guidelines, and applying the framework to create a roadmap for implementation.\newline

The literature and data analysis revealed the high complexity of the context and could determine gaps in the data situation on water sources as well as the project and framework landscape in regard to \acrlong{cs} approaches in the given context for the implementation in a \acrshort{fbf} project. However, the general feasibility of the approach for the project was suggested through further analysis. Building on this positive assessment, the identified frameworks and guidelines were adapted and expanded to ultimately lead to the development of a new replicable and adaptable framework for a community-based participatory water source mapping and monitoring in the context of \acrlong{fbf}. Its application on this specific case area resulted in a roadmap for the practical implementation of the project. This roadmap includes goals and sub-goals, required products and respective activities.\newline

In this discussion chapter, the focus is on reflecting on the main findings and contributions of this study and discuss their implications for further developments and practical applications. In detail, each research objective is addressed in turn and its relevance to the research aim is discussed. Finally, limitations and challenges encountered during the research process are named and considered.

% The identification of the conceptual context along with the literature and \acrshort{cs} project analysis could successfully build a sound foundation for this work and specify relevant aspects and gaps for addressing the first and subsequent research objectives.
Besides addressing the first objective, to \textit{conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature and guidelines related to the design and implementation of \acrlong{cs} programmes, and identify relevant work in regard to the research aim and overall case study context} the literature and \acrshort{cs} project analysis could also create a sound foundation for the following study (see section \ref{subsec:stage1_appl}). % The exploration of the conceptual and practical context allowed the identification and specification of relevant frameworks, aspects and gaps in literature for the subsequent research objectives.\newline
Breaking down the broad concepts of Water Security, Water Scarcity and Drought along with their indicators and indices to the local context highlighted that only relatively rough forecasts are available for Somaliland (see section \ref{subsec:indicators}). Currently, climate, weather and hazard forecasts for Somaliland are either based on international indices like SPI or on a scarce network of local weather gauging stations (see section \ref*{subsec:case_eap}). Besides their coarseness, these indices predict the climate or weather itself and not its impacts, making them unsuitable for \acrlong{fbf} (see section \ref*{subsec:eap}). For successful implementation of \acrshort{fbf}, triggers and actions should be developed and directly linked (see section \ref{subsec:trigger} and \ref{subsec:case_eap}). This is often not feasible as local information about water sources is either missing completely, is incomplete or outdated (see section \ref{subsec:stage1_appl}). This highlighted the need for new local impact indicators for the creation of which the \acrshort{cs} approach was consulted. Several \acrshort{cbm}, \acrshort{mcs}, \acrshort{cbs}, \acrshort{cbwm} and other risk related \acrshort{cs} frameworks and respective guidelines could be identified but none of them exactly matched the intended application (see section \ref{sec:cs}). While "there is no one-size-fits-all approach" \autocite[2]{fraislCitizenScienceEnvironmental2022}, the existing frameworks either focussed on different thematics, different contexts, had different participation levels, different goals or a combination of the above (see sections \ref{subsubsec:cbwm}, \ref{subsubsec:cbs} and \ref{subsec:cbc}). This is consistent with \autocite{butteFrameworkWaterSecurity2022}'s and \autocite{carrionCROWDSOURCINGWATERQUALITY2020}'s findings that existing frameworks guiding the development of water security data collection projects are often very specific and limited to certain factors, in many cases also not taking socio-economic factors into account. At the same time, frameworks like the on from \autocite{butteFrameworkWaterSecurity2022,eu-citizen.scienceEUCitizenScience,citizenscience.govBasicStepsYour} and others were too broad, to be more than general guidelines. Therefore, no applicable framework existed for the implementation of a community-based participatory mapping and monitoring of water sources approach in a water-scarce and resource-limited setting. Especially not, with the focus on providing feasible information for triggering \acrshortpl{aa} in the context of an \acrshort{eap} and in collaboration with a \acrshort{rcrc} National Society.% irgendwo habe ich noch einen Absatz rumfliegen, der genau das anspricht.. dass es zwar viele frameworks gibt, aber genau deswegen, da es so komplex ist..
Other networks like \acrlong{brcis} and the local branch of \acrshort{ocha} implemented their own early action approaches in Somaliland. However, on the one hand with different goals, and on the other hand with different methods (see sections \ref{subsec:stage1_appl} and \ref{subsec:case_eap}). While \acrshort{brcis} collects and interpolates qualitative local information, \acrshort{ocha} bases their early actions on the before mentioned large scale indicators. These approaches are either too slow or to coarse to address the aim of this research, but the concrete experiences from projects in the case study area are valuable to adapt and relate other information to the given context. The transfer of knowledge from other regions, projects and topics is necessary, as scientific literature about the case study area of Somaliland is generally scarce. In addition to these case study related domains, there are further gaps in knowledge when in comes to the application of the \acrshort{fbf} approach on the slow-onset hazard of drought. Generally, the concept of \acrshort{fbf} is now well established in regard to fast-onset disasters, but the drought use case is relatively new (2020) and not yet well researched, which severely limits the amount of guidelines and frameworks available for this particular application (see section \ref{subsec:eap}). Thus, each new project or study focussing on this hazard in the context of \acrshort{fbf} has, at least in part, an exploratory character.\newline
As any new project or study addressing this hazard within these concepts is thus 'automatically' exploratory in nature and no other suitable framework could be identified, the literature and project review suggested the need to develop a new framework to address the specifics of the case study (see section \ref{subsec:cbm}). However, before the new conceptualisation, the general feasibility had to be assessed first, leading to the second objective of this work.

\section{Feasibility Assessment}
% especially the extensions with red flags was new here

Since the feasibility had to be determined before this work could move on to address the other research objectives and questions, the second objective to \textit{assess the feasibility of the \acrlong{cs} approach in the given context by identifying potential challenges and opportunities for successful implementation, and to propose recommendations for addressing these challenges} was an interim result of the work. Based on the developed framework in section \ref{subsec:stage2_design} the feasibility was already assessed in sections \ref{subsec:stage1_appl} and \ref{subsec:stage2_appl}. This assessment combined and applied general, international guidance from many projects and studies with local experiences with the \acrshort{cbs} program. It is believed that, even though no dedicated pilot study could be conducted, this combination and interpolation of experiences can reasonably suggest the feasibility of the \acrshort{cs} concept for this application. However, this claim can ultimately only be verified or falsified by a pilot study on site. Furthermore, several challenges such as the embedding into local decision-making and processes, actual tailoring to local conditions and clarifying financial capacities could not further be investigated due to the limited amount of interviews with local stakeholders and ongoing developments of the superordinate project.\newline
Due to the already conducted discussion in section \ref{subsec:stage2_appl} and challenges that cannot be investigated further in this context, the remaining part of this section focusses more on how, why and in what order this assessment was realised as it is believed that this holds more value to the reader than iterating over the discussion again.\newline
Since, to the best of my knowledge, no work has been conducted with the combination of methods, goals and context of this work, there was no concrete existing guidance to assess the feasibility of this approach to achieve the research's aim in the first place. The lack of suitable frameworks for this project made it thus necessary to work on the development of the framework and its application step by step and not only chronologically, at least to some extent. This was facilitated by the iterative working approach, which made it possible to first sketch out possible solutions and then deepen them when the conditions were met accordingly. This was also the case in addressing the second objective and the early conduction of the feasibility assessment is also recommended by multiple other guidelines \autocite{citizenscience.govBasicStepsYour,garciaFindingWhatYou2021,ifrcCommunityBasedSurveillanceGuiding2017,ifrcFbFPractitionersManual2023b,minkmanCitizenScienceWater2015}.\newline
The \acrlong{ssf} and \acrlong{slmc} were adopted at an early stage of the work to have a general direction for the development. To conduct the assessment, the third research objective had to be somewhat anticipated in order to provide an initial framework for the structured feasibility assessment. This framework, now conceptually integrated in the second stage of the design roadmap (see section \ref{subsec:stage2_design}) was in the beginning primarily a combination of the \acrshort{ssf}'s second stage and the feasibility assessment of the \acrshort{cbs} of the \acrshort{ifrc}. The final feasibility assessment took place on the current basis, which was further underpinned with some additional guidelines, best practices and knowledge of the interviewees over the course of multiple iterations.\newline
When designing a framework for or directly assessing the feasibility of \acrshort{cs}, it becomes clear that \textit{feasibility} depends on a variety of factors, but also that there are no clear rules that must be followed. Each \acrshort{cs} project is somewhat special and the flexible concept also allows for several adaptations (see section \ref{sec:cs}). Therefore, the feasibility is not assessed by a specific set of rules, but rather how well it relates to general principles and factors of success. This makes sense in the way, that what specifically works in e.g. \autocite{minkmanCitizenScienceWater2015}'s approach in the Netherlands may not be feasible in Somaliland, e.g. the use of smartphone sensors as the rural population in Somaliland has few smartphones and internet coverage is poor. Assessing challenges and opportunities is thus a highly specific and local task and depends on many factors.\newline
Nonetheless, the \acrshort{ecsa} along with many other associations and studies developed \acrshort{cs} principles and characteristics that support the successful design, implementation and operation of a \acrshort{cs} project. Furthermore, a \acrshort{cbs} project was already successfully implemented and in operation for several years within the context and the \acrshort{srcs} but focused on a different topic. This, again highlights the thorough analysis of local comparable projects, mentioned in stage 1, section \ref{subsec:stage1_design}. The actual feasibility assessment therefore focussed primarily on the differences between the \acrshort{cbs} and the potential water source mapping and monitoring project.\newline

\section{A Replicable and Adaptable Framework}
% --> why only participatory levels (1) and (2) (ssf)

Having established the feasibility of the \acrshort{cs} approach, the third objective to \textit{develop a replicable and adaptable framework for community-based participatory water source mapping and monitoring in the context of \acrlong{fbf}, based on the principles and recommendations identified in objectives 1 and 2} could be pursued. There are now a high number and wide variety of guidelines, \acrshort{cs} associations, initiatives and projects to choose from, that the question of the necessity to add just another one to the list suggests itself. The literature analysis suggested that, above all, the high variety is explained and reflected in the high diversity of the \acrshort{cs} approach of e.g. methodology, temporal and spatial scale, goals, context, level of participation and overall goal (see section \ref{sec:cs}). \autocite{fraislCitizenScienceEnvironmental2022, westonCommunityBasedWaterMonitoring2015} and \autocite{zhengCrowdsourcingMethodsData2018} all summarise a wide variety of these guidelines and \autocite{garciaFindingWhatYou2021} even created a \textit{Guide to Citizen Science Guidelines}. Nonetheless, none of these met the needs of this work, which prompted the development of a new framework. That goes along with the recommendations, of \autocite{garciaFindingWhatYou2021}, that the development and thus transfer of experience in guidelines is the currently the best practice in the field when new, previously unrealised combinations of the thematic diversity listed above are approached and realised \autocite{garciaFindingWhatYou2021}. This highlights the need, that frameworks need to be focussed on a specific topic, region and environment in order to give meaningful advice and not only generic information that is too coarse to be of great use.\newline
The decision to build on \autocite{fraislCitizenScienceEnvironmental2022}'s \acrlong{ssf} was primarily driven by its timeliness, comprehensiveness and focus on environmental issues as it was clear, that a more social and local component can be integrated from the \acrshort{srcs}'s experiences with \acrshort{cbs}. The usefulness of the interpolation of these two approaches was particularly evident in the consideration of personal data. While observing natural phenomena at the level of data collection did not raise too many privacy concerns for \autocite{fraislCitizenScienceEnvironmental2022}, this was almost the opposite for CBS \autocite{ifrcCommunityBasedSurveillanceGuiding2017}. Applying these contrasting perspectives to the issue of water sources was thus able to address both the physical and social components well by considering trade-offs between the two 'extremes'. This claim was further supported over the course of this work, when the iterative integration of other guidelines from several divergent foci into the existing framework could be implemented smoothly and only minor revisions had to be made. \autocite{mcgowanCommunitybasedSurveillanceInfectious2022} also found that the success factors of \acrshort{cbs} are closely linked to the general principles of participatory community engagement and could therefore be transferred to other participatory surveillance preparedness activities. As the individual stages are outlined and described in detail in section \ref{sec:design_roadmap} and all identified relatable guidance is included into the design roadmap, no further discussion of the individual stages will be undertaken. % geht das so durch (?)
Nonetheless, this processual \acrshort{ssf} has some short-comings which will mostly be addressed in the discussion of its actual application (section \ref{TODO:}) and following limitation section \ref{TODO:} of this entire work.\newline
However, a couple of shortcomings became apparent right at the beginning of the application in the third phase. It was increasingly difficult to keep an overview of the actual project requirements and their interdependencies in terms of subject matter and temporal constraints (see section \ref{subsec:project_requirements} and \ref{subsubsec:knowledge}). Furthermore, \acrshort{cbs}, \acrshort{cbwm} and other approaches have strongly emphasised the importance of embedding the project into prevailing social and decision-making conditions and procedures, which was under-represented in the \acrshort{ssf} (see section \ref{subsubsec:groundwork}). The Interviewees also highlighted, the time (over a year) and resource requirements, which they needed for the development and adaptation of methods and techniques to start with the \acrshort{cbs} project in Somaliland (I2, I3). This goes along with \autocite{garciaFindingWhatYou2021}'s findings, that some adjustments and tailoring always need to be done when implementing a new project (see section \ref{subsubsec:innovations}). Together with the emerging need to structure smaller developments and create an overview of decision dependencies, a fourth area of management became apparent that needed to be addressed >(see section \ref{subsubsec:management}). These reasons provided the ground for the new development of the \acrlong{prc} to expand the \acrshort{ssf} from the third phase onwards. Since the first and second stages are primarily exploratory in nature, it is believed that the \acrshort{prc} should not be integrated in these stages, as it could limit the exploration to the given categories. Should something be overlooked, completions are still possible at the beginning of the third phase.\newline
The conceptualisation and structure of the \acrshort{prc} with the \acrlong{slmc}, guided by the derived goals by \autocite{minkmanCitizenScienceWater2015} further supports the structuring and elaboration of the dependency. Emphasis is given to the top three layers, the \textit{Goal-, Products-, and Activities-Layer}., firstly due to time and information constraints and secondly as practical applicable\textit{ methods, techniques, tools and scripts} need to be highly adjusted to the local context (see section \ref{subsec:slmc}). Both are main limitations of this work and will further be discussed in the last section of this chapter. Nonetheless, the limitation of this work may not be true for subsequent work, which can then benefit from the deeper and more detailed structural possibilities of the \acrshort{slmc}. Despite the fact that the thematic focus of the \acrshort{slmc} is not on \acrshort{cs}, the overall design pattern could be adopted well. The successful preservation of design patterns to other fields is also supported by \autocite{diggelenGroundedDesignDesign2009}'s findings. Thus, although the work has a sound methodological basis, it is primarily based on the perspective of a process- and requirements-oriented understanding and reasoning of the design phase. Other perspectives such as resource, behavioural network or stakeholder networks, cultural norms and values, as well as the communication network perspective may play a role in certain aspects, but are of secondary importance in this work. Engaging these other perspectives more in depth could yield further important insights by encouraging a more holistic view of the design.

% The division into several stages was also adopted by \autocite{citizenscience.govBasicStepsYour}, for example, and could represent procedural developments well.

\section{Application}

The fourth research objective to \textit{apply the adapted and developed framework to establish a roadmap for the implementation of a water source mapping and monitoring approach to trigger appropriate anticipatory actions to address water shortages} has already been partially addressed under the first two objectives. Stage 1 was primarily addressed by the first research objective which explored much of the underlying concepts, context, prevailing problems and also carved out potential solutions. Stage 2, the feasibility assessment, was addressed with the second research objective. Therefore, this section concentrates on the stages three to six.\newline
In stage 3, the subdivision into the \acrshort{prc} was helpful to reduce cognitive overload and highlight chronological and thematic (inter-) dependencies. In terms of knowledge, the \acrshort{prc} helped to structure the identified information from stages 1 and 2, which additionally helped to make knowledge gaps, such as e.g. missing detailed knowledge about local decision-making procedures, obvious. As it is was not feasible to gather these information in the scope of this work, it was therefore simplified to concentrate on those areas, that could be tackled. For example, it became clear that the initial mapping, which includes gathering other key information about the berkad, cannot be done by local volunteers as the knowledge and technical equipment requirements are too high for most. Thus the initial mapping needs to be conducted by the \acrshort{srcs} professionals who are already experienced and don't need further guidance for the process. Nonetheless, gathering the information that is initially required was feasible in the context of the work and thus focussed on. The knowledge gathered was thus more broad than deep and in most cases requires further investigation, especially in relation to local conditions. For example, in the case of the \acrshort{aa} of water trucking, see figure \ref{TODO:} in section \ref{subsubsec:assemblage}, requirements could be listed, but their actual specification is only possible on the ground with local stakeholders.\newline
Close and early cooperation with other local actors in the area of embedding the project in conceptual water management practice was also suggested as important by the interviewees (see section \ref{subsubsec:groundwork_appl}). This compares well with common recommendations for \acrshort{cs} projects (see section \ref{sec:cs}). To facilitate this, a light \acrshort{iwrm} framework which was also already tested in other local circumstances could be identified in \autocite{dayCommunitybasedWaterResources2009}'s adaptation. Yet, the same limitations apply here, as the actual feasibility can only assessed on the ground. Nonetheless, the willingness and experience of local managers to implement those concepts could be identified, which suggests at least a good initial situation for the successful embedding of the project into local management practices. The great importance of deep local embedding is also highlighted by \autocite{gualazziniEWEAEarlyWarning2021} because even if the information gathered is good and timely, it still needs to be incorporated in decision-making and acted upon.\newline
Besides the conceptual groundwork directly on site, innovations for the determination and collection of water level thresholds are required. The gathered information suggest, that there are two potential ways to assess the water level (see section \ref{subsubsec:innovations_appl}). The technical measuring and transmission of the actual water height would require the knowledge about the exact capacity and size of the berkad to assess the water level. Although this method would provide a more objective measurement, local knowledge of the potential duration of water supply was also found to be good with a Berkad (see section \ref{subsubsec:assemblage}). Both approaches do not contradict each other and could also be used together. This would also allow a good basis over time for evaluating the quality of the assessment of local which could what could then improve local water management. In addition to the quantity of water, its quality was also considered very important, but no locally feasible approach to assessing quality could be identified. This supports the importance of providing a sound knowledge foundation about contamination prevention and water management practices to the community. This is also supported by several other studies \autocite{danielAssessingDrinkingWater2020,huangManagementDrinkingWater2020,tariqOpenSourceWater2021,wmoPlanningWaterqualityMonitoring2013}. Research in this field is still ongoing \autocite{tariqOpenSourceWater2021} and \autocite{delaireHowMuchWill2017} cost estimations suggest, that even with current equipment, costs are minimal in relation to achieving the SDG 6.1 of safe water for all.\newline
While no management decision or concrete developments could be made in the scope of this work, the results suggest some additional considerations. In the case of deciding for a specific water source monitoring strategy, all accessible water sources in a community should be monitored, as the largest, e.g. a ballay, is not necessarily the one that can withstand a period of drought the longest. Physical as well as social access factors need to be considered in terms of actual water withdrawal and monitoring when deciding on the actual monitoring routine see section \ref{subsubsec:assemblage}. Furthermore, the results support the feasibility and usefulness of a staggered trigger as proposed by \autocite{rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020} for triggering on water level thresholds as both, a seasonal and a short-term assessment are possible. In terms of \acrshortpl{aa}, the results mostly supported the feasibility of water trucking and cash transfer \acrshortpl{aa} (see section \ref{subsec:case_eap} and \ref{subsubsec:assemblage}), which compares well with \autocite{gettliffeOCHAAnticipatoryAction2021} findings. Yet, when comparing this finding with the statements of the interviewees from section \ref{subsec:stage1_appl} that water is often over prized in times of scarcity and with the statement of \autocite{ochaANTICIPATORYACTIONPLAN2020} that markets need to be operational to permit this handling of the demand, distributions of cash or water vouchers may not always be feasible as \acrshort{aa}. Besides the social factors \autocite{birchSomalilandSomaliRegion2008} further highlights that impact on natural ecosystems through water availability for animals need to be considered when addressing water shortages. 
% “Additionally, there may be limitations related to designing and implementing citizen science projects in remote and unsafe areas, where crime levels are high and political risks exist, or where mobile network coverage is poor, access to smartphones and electricity is low and illiteracy levels among participants are high. Co-design and community-based approaches can address such challenges and ensure a high level of participant engagement20” ([Fraisl et al., 2022, p. 14](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/FBJD7SWS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7WBDKYDY?page=14&annotation=MZ95QT2P))
The community building aspect in stage 4 was mainly focussed on assessing the capacities of the \acrshort{srcs}. The findings suggested good capacities and high experiences in the area of community engagement as well as volunteer training and supervision (see section \ref{subsec:stage4_appl} and \ref{subsec:stage2_appl}). This was to be expected, as the \acrshort{srcs} already implemented a comparable project and was also found to be performing well within the framework of the overarching \acrshort{fbf} project. Findings of Stage 5 \textit{Data management} support the technical practicability of the project. The solution of the implemented \acrshort{cbs} project with the NYSS platform was found to be very dedicated and technically adaptable to the new requirements. Currently, discussions about the adaptation are ongoing on management level. In addition to this very automated and already well-rehearsed system, however, several other potential systems could be identified which, although not quite as advanced or tailored, would also suffice for the application for the time being (see section \ref{subsec:stage5_appl}and \ref{subsec:mcs}).\newline
A major concern of data collected by \acrshort{cs} is their quality and accuracy. This is well addressed in the current \acrshort{cbs} program with initial and refresher trainings, close supervision and further verifications when necessary. Together with the built-in automatic checks in NYSS, measures of \acrshort{qc} and \acrshort{qa} are well considered. It is expected that these mechanisms can be translated to the new project largely addressing quality concerns right from the start. Constructed validity needs to be addressed by further data triangulation, as the simple measurement of the water level itself does not proof, that the underlying reason for low water levels is indeed a drought but could also be reasoned by social factors (see section \ref{subsec:water_scarcity}). Evaluation practices are integrated in every stage but due to no actual implementation and operation, evaluation could not be conducted. Nonetheless, the design process, due to its iterative processes underwent several evaluations and piecemeal improvements itself suggesting good adaptability and upgradeability.\newline
The overall application of the developed framework worked well and the combination of the \acrshort{ssf} together with the \acrshort{prc} based on the \acrshort{slmc} could provide good guidance while also remaining flexible to incorporate new, unexpected findings. Yet, the entire power of the \acrshort{slmc} could not be exploited as the coming layers were too detailed and most of those need to be determined in closer collaboration with the team and the local stakeholders. Nonetheless, based on the positive experiences with the first three stages, it is believed that the following layers will also prove fruitful to potential future developments.\newline
The application also supports the findings of \autocite{garciaFindingWhatYou2021} and \autocite{conradCommunityBasedMonitoringFrameworks2008} that a framework should be used but also highlights the need to adapt this framework the actual projects conditions and goal. Furthermore, the work suggests that a respective implementation of a \acrlong{cs} project is not only theoretically feasible but practically implementable. While an end to end establishment of an implementation roadmap was not feasible in the context of this work due to several information, resource and time constraints, a sound foundation could be laid for further practical implementation in the scope of a pilot study. Yet, important questions need to be answered on management level and not all indicators are in favour of a practical application. For example, the \acrshort{rcrc} is generally not recommending its National Societies to implement their own data gathering strategies as this would, under normal circumstances over-burden and exceed costs \autocite{rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020}. Therefore, \autocite{rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020} generally recommends to found the triggers and information on already gathered information by other stakeholders or international organisations. As suggested by the results, this is not feasible in this context. Furthermore, the analysis of the \acrshort{cbs} approach and other projects together with the feasibility assessment and conducted application of this work suggest that \acrshort{cs} can be reasonable and cost-effective approach to gather relevant information. This is also supported by \autocite{aceves-buenoCitizenScienceApproach2015} and \autocite{minkmanCitizenScienceWater2015} findings. Timely and accurate data can support the appropriate \acrlongpl{aa} to be tailored, making mitigation and response potentially more streamlined, efficient and effective.\newline

\section{Limitations}
% theoretical foundation
In any research project, limitations are an important aspect to consider and some were already addressed in the above discussion. Yet, there are further limitations that need to be acknowledged. The literature review did not follow a strict formal structure and that comparable projects may have been overlooked, although unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, this exploratory approach also allowed for the discovery of many, formerly unknown aspects and contributed many insights to the study. The subsequent in depth literature review, although not formal, was detailed and extended and was able to identify and close some gaps. However, the generally sparse literature on Somaliland limited the desk-based collection of information about local conditions. Furthermore, this work has also not addressed the integration or application of local and/or indigenous knowledge or the further use of VGI, to the extent that this would have been possible in principle. Although both areas are very interesting, this was either not the focus of this work or, the case of available water source datasets and VGI an in-depth analysis had been deemed unsuitable due to the poor quality identified early on. Nevertheless, insights could be gained from the data using more refined methods in future work. On the theoretical level of the contextual basis, the concepts mentioned, such as water security, drought or Citizen Science, are extremely complex and highly debated topics. Discussing them in detail would have exceeded the scope of this thesis, which is why focal points were set according to the priority of this work.\newline
% exploratory approach
The inclusive nature of the exploratory approach, was thus tried to be addressed by information triangulation from other studies but it made for a generally more consensual work and fewer contradictory findings. This, together with the inclusion of most relatable studies and projects into the framework itself, also made for a relatively homogeneous discussion due to the lack of contradictory findings. It is expected that this comparison with other work will be possible in the future as more CS projects are carried out in a similar context and with similar objectives.\newline
% case study
The critique of the case study research type, its challenge to execute, significant documentation efforts and complex nature also had certain shares in this work. Nevertheless, its strength of being rich, detailed and contextual also contributed positively. The generalisability of the understanding gained through actual application can be considered low, but the applicability of the framework developed can be expected to be transferable to other comparable contexts.\newline
% validities and biases
An attempt was made to improve internal validity through the iterative design, reciprocal reviews and triangulation of multiple sources of information, but despite great efforts, it is hardly possible to establish causal relationships in such a complex environment. Constructed validity of the framework is believed to be reasonable due the extensive triangulation of resources but can only be tested in a practical examination. The importance of data triangulation was also noted and integrated in the actual application. Interviews always add a human factor which can complicate repeatability but clear procedures and documentation were established to account for this as best as possible. The expert and snowball sampling strategy itself worked well, but was severely limited by other factors. The interviews always had to be arranged and signed off by senior managers, and the already tense situation with ongoing response activities and parallel \acrshort{fbf} development in Somaliland made the availability of interviewees even scarcer. This resulted in a relatively low sample of interviewees, limiting the otherwise strength of a case study to incorporate a multitude of perspectives on one area of interest. Here, interviews especially with representatives of \acrshort{nadfor}, the \acrshort{mowr} and \acrshort{moh} as well as \acrshort{brcis} and \acrshort{ocha} mights have been fruitful. The conversion of one interview into a questionnaire hindered direct clarification and follow-up questions in the interview, but this could be compensated for by a second questionnaire. Since a lot of information could be drawn from the answers and the interview could not have taken place otherwise, this can ultimately be seen as a good compromise.\newline
% overall
Overall, the study was conducted under difficult conditions in a case study area known for its complex and difficult environment. The generally limited time and resources available in the context of a Master's thesis further constrained the study and the focus on just the development of the framework might have been beneficial. Nevertheless, it is believed that the study conducted was ultimately able to provide a good theoretical and structural basis for a potential practical implementation of this approach. Furthermore, this study contributes to the general ongoing discourse of \acrlong{cs}-projects by adding a work from a currently underrepresented region. It is to be expected that in the further process of this discourse many of the limitations mentioned here can be addressed and overcome.

% keeping data up to date is crucial in ensuring correct vulnerability and exposure data 
% “Vulnerability and exposure changes over time, particularly after an extreme weather or climate event. Datasets must be kept up to date to ensure the impact-based forecast or warning using this data is reliable. Recognise that many official governmental data sources, such as a national census or demographic and health surveys, are updated infrequently – every five or ten years.” ([Harrowsmith et al., 2020, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QJ397Y54)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2GS362N5?page=28&annotation=5XVAQCTY)

% recommended to combine the BRCiS appraoch with I1 categorization. one more extensive long-term assessment at the end of the rain season together with the other rarely changing indicators (e.g. number of animals and people) but also combined with an triangulation with stakeholder and thorough analysis and interpretation of data --> integration into decision-making processes. --> seasonal warning and identification of vulnerability + short-term facilitation of immediate action with the short-term water level warnings

% -	Water levels in berkeds could be a good indicator, however it cannot be a stand alone indicator. This has to be combined by meteorological forecasts and local knowledge as well.
% - Regarding Anticipatory actions, there has been any actions yet due to the fact that there is no water monitoring and trigger mechanism in place.
% Beyond data collection, \autocite{gualazziniEWEAEarlyWarning2021} highlights the possibility to adopt a two-way communication capability to also distribute climate and weather forecasts to participants. Thus "communities have direct access to short-term weather forecasts and climate risk alerts to mitigate risk and protect livelihoods, while also providing information from the site" \autocite[20]{gualazziniEWEAEarlyWarning2021}. % ITIKI may also contribute to this statement
