% discussion:
% read some guidelines mate. just read some guidelines. Bed time. can't think anymore.
% last big chapter! Woop Woop!!
% discuss context e.g. water security, water scarcity and drought
% discuss FbF and CS

%	SECTION 1
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The development of a guideance for this project may seem overkill as so many guidelines already exist but none was made for such as topic in such a context --> summarisation was necessary. --> generalisation is potentially possible when the case study is conducted and maybe more case-studies are integrated (multi-case-study design elevates external validity) and a manual could be the goal... 


\section{Main Section 1}
as: preparatory study (??)


(in the discussion)
-> Reiterate the Research Problem/State the Major Findings
-> Explain the Meaning of the Findings and Why They are Important
-> Relate the Findings to Similar Studies
-> Consider Alternative Explanations of the Findings
-> Acknowledge the Study's Limitations
-> Suggest Areas for Further Research


OCHA and BRCiS are alternative strategies --> overall relevant for the EAP but not directly for this work, too specialized, could also be intergrated. OCHA and BRCiS have different foci

\subsection{Discussion indices and forecasts}

Nonetheless, it needs to be mentioned, that most indices will always be proxies for other conditions, which can not or only very arduously be measured. 

“A major weakness of the existing tools is the emphasis on macro/international level information.” ([Masinde and Bagula, 2010, p. 390](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/JNC4ACZS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/IWMKDQYV?page=1&annotation=7Z44Z9L7))

“While food security forecasts may be an acceptable means for mobilizing global funding earlier, this does not imply that the underlying crisis is strictly a food security crisis.” ([OCHA, 2020, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/NYQL45SA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3PG9LF86?page=7&annotation=JD7JZTTN))

“. In fact, needs are multi-dimensional, interrelated and complex” ([OCHA, 2020, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/NYQL45SA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3PG9LF86?page=7&annotation=SMBIBQ3G))

localization of forecasts and so on.. why it is difficult to use SPEI, SPI and so on and others.. --> more data to operationalize is very important, even though it should not be the task of the SRCS --> high costs but a lot of trust in the communities and CBS is also working great.

“There has been little effort to align the spatiotemporal granularity of socioeconomic assessments with the granularity of weather or climate monitoring.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1161](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=1&annotation=QBTLFCXM))

“but questions related to coping capacities, migration, poverty, water supply, access to food and markets, or political conflict remain unanswered or are even decoupled from routine drought risk assessments” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1162](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=2&annotation=HE48ZWFA))

“The handbook of drought indicators (Svoboda et al. 2016) lists more than 50 drought indices.

However, the study was limited by the low security levels in Somalia that makes

Somalia led to the collapse of hydro-meteorological monitoring network

research vs. reality

other perspectives than process oriented -> 7-layer model self-critisism (resource, behavioral perspectives, + value and communication network design approaches)

“It is important to note that local indicators cannot be collected specifically for the FbF system by RCRC national societies.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=LRDPV2M7))

“Indeed, collecting data on local indicators would require from the national society a team of enumerators that work continually to collect and process that information in all places where the program could possibly trigger (e.g. collect food price information for every village market). This would have extensive cost implications and likely over-burden the national society staff and volunteers.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=2YIIK6ZY))

“As such, the inclusion of local indicators into an FbA trigger must involve assessing what indicators are relevant for the impacts the program is trying to anticipate and identify which of those indicators are already collected (e.g. the ministry of agriculture's food price bulletin) and are available at the time they would be needed to inform a possible trigger.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=7X3RFGVB))

“Thinking outside the box in terms of both hydro-meteorological and socio-economic indicators could be particularly useful” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 31](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=31&annotation=GNZJ3FR5))


The \textit{Drought Monitoring Tool for Somalia} FAOSWALIM is currently also looking for alternative indicators for their Combined Drought Index (CDI) since the current proxy for soil moisture, NDVI does not correlate well with ground information anymore.  https://cdi.faoswalim.org/index/cdi

% stakeholder perceptions and limitations
difference scientific vs. stakeholders perception of drought impact
“The comparison between stakeholders’ perception of drought impacts and scientific knowledge allowed us to draw some preliminary conclusions concerning both the drought impacts at local level and the coherence between local and scientific knowledge on drought impacts.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 539](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=17\&annotation=QFD3UE4C))

“the correlation degree between perception indicators and scientific indicators is high only when considering a direct impact of drought, for example the reduction of productivity for non-irrigated crops.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 540](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=18&annotation=6KRIS4DA))
“Firstly, stakeholders tend to oversimplify the cause-effect chain” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 540](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=18&annotation=IBV34JQL))
“Stakeholders seem to focus exclusively on the portion of the system they perceived.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=73P565M3))
“On the one hand, this allows them to have a clear picture of the evolutionary trends of the different variables that make up that portion of the system” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=ZJSACLXJ))
“On the other hand, due to the limitations of their viewpoint, stakeholders tend to neglect the existence of multiple causes for certain observed phenomena.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=8CUNSCXS))
“Secondly, the data collected shows that the stakeholders tend to aggregate the variables describing the drought impacts, for example the impacts of crop productivity vary dramatically according to the crop under consideration, whereas stakeholders perceived a general reduction in productivity.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=TT7JRW3U))

\subsection{Citizen Science}

\autocite[20]{gualazziniEWEAEarlyWarning2021} highlights the value of \acrshort{cbm} triangulated data as it ensures the consideration of local perspective in "high-level aggregated data and early action decision-making processes" and decentralises disaster management. 

% some random piece of text.. maybe recycle, maybe not. Possibly not.
One approach that is fusing the CBM and the MCS approach is Community-based Surveillance (CBM). Thus far, CBM is predominantly used in the context of epidemiology and other health related issues, incorporating mobile messaging applications with on site awareness training and first response knowledge. This community-based management component is seen as the foundation in most of the programs and the following information collection and transmission in terms of the MCS is just regarded as the second step. Nonetheless, this second step can and already did facilitate numerous early preventions and actions in various manners.

%\acrshort*{mcs} has great potential to cover wide areas and even extend monitoring efforts to an entire country, but local conditions must be taken into account to contribute to a successful project outcome\autocite{huangManagementDrinkingWater2020}. 

% Challenges:
“Challenges and risks have related to: securing free SMS channels for alerts, time required for contextualised design, ensuring response action, and managing expectations of the scope of CBS.” ([Byrne and Nichol, 2020, p. 71](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/R9QNVPU8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/VFH6JVJS?page=2&annotation=KKVDV6DE))

“The results suggest that citizen science can be a cost-effective method to collect essential monitoring information and can also produce the high levels of citizen engagement that are vital to the adaptive management learning process.” ([Aceves-Bueno et al., 2015, p. 493](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/YK2MKLA9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/WGGHNGZB?page=1&annotation=ZQQBEP74))

“Even when receiving timely information on the ground, Members often had to wait for validation from national sources such as the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) to make decisions, and the resources for anticipatory action were very limited.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=4&annotation=CZST8S2L))


%limitations: 
“Additionally, there may be limitations related to designing and implementing citizen science projects in remote and unsafe areas, where crime levels are high and political risks exist, or where mobile network coverage is poor, access to smartphones and electricity is low and illiteracy levels among participants are high.

,“Climate information presented as early warnings are only as valuable as the actions that are taken in response to the information, even if the information is a perfect warning of future events.” ([Mariani et al., 2015, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/8THVVJVK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GYUFNK32?page=8&annotation=Y9DG5FSE))



%During the development of an \acrshort{eap} more and complex challenges need to be addressed such as the lack of coordination and integration between sectors, limited capacities on the ground to decide and react accordingly due to data and resource shortages as well as the reality that they often work in areas where they have to operate in a complex network of actors and conflicting interests.

% --> language is important. --> staggered trigger -> cannot call everything an action! There is a difference between small and large repsonsen etc.. especially in the perception of people
“We also found that the phrases we had been using to trigger action, Be Aware, Be Prepared and Take Action, were not driving the actions we had hoped. We used Take Action exclusively for high impact warnings, but we need people to be taking action for low and medium impact warnings too, if the impacts are to be mitigated. We have replaced these phrases with detailed impact information and linked our warnings to advice and guidance from our partner organisations.” ([Harrowsmith et al., 2020, p. 62](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QJ397Y54)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2GS362N5?page=62&annotation=KZK3TSK3))


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%% trigger:
“Given the different layers of complexity with drought, different types of triggers may be required beyond what is often used in EAP development. For instance, unconventional triggers for FbA for drought could include metrics such as staple food prices, percentages of crop failure, and other elements of food security early warning systems.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=JZV26DPP))
% --> even the RCRC is still looking for good triggers -> maybe water levels are a good way -> reasoning for this study

This works follows the “general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=2&annotation=BTE2JFKV)) which is basically “community-based monitoring, which also explicitly focuses on the public ’s involvement in monitoring processes” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=2&annotation=K4URWWLV))

“Local citizens are seen as essential participants in collaborative environmental management because they can provide vital information about the area’s natural and sociopolitical systems as well as support for measures to address non–point source pollution” ([Koehler and Koontz, 2008, p. 143](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/2PKW9CYX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/YYG4JK3R?page=1&annotation=MV6JAERB))


“Furthermore it is an interesting communication tool in the light of science communication. Correspondingly water managers should be interested in participatory monitoring in the light of integrated water management.” ([Minkman, 2015, p. 199](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/ZKLE6CPT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/QMAPCSZG?page=199&annotation=GHI9KSDA))

% in comparison to sensor networks:
“It is suggested, based on literature, that water authorities might prefer MCS to wireless sensor networks, for its mobility, lower costs and scalability.” ([Minkman, 2015, p. 11](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/ZKLE6CPT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/QMAPCSZG?page=11&annotation=RM5PX55M))

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% water scarcity and rural water sources
“Community cultures, economies, and environments differ across countries and regions. These differences should be considered when designing hybrid management strategies, so that all actors can be appropriately enabled and the mechanism which is most effective for the given community can be identified.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=WV5DXV5I))

“On this basis, it is essential to expand research area to study the various threats from climate variability to rural drinking water safety, and then to develop corresponding measures to address those threats to water security.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=HCQHR7YR))

\subsection{Discussion of the methods}




% about the slmc
In this work, emphasis is given to the top three layers, the \textit{Goal-, Products-, and Activities-Layer}., firstly due to time and information constraints and secondly as practical applicable methods need to be highly adjusted to the local context. This will further be discussed and outlined in subsequent chapters.

discussion: the SLMC was good until general activities - then: it has to become quite detailed --> not feasible in the scope of this work. but a good framework to continue the work with.


% about SLMC
-> sub-sub-activities or products could also be labelled differently.. not all levels were clear and distinct

--> Methods, techniques, tools and scripts need to be created/developed -> therefore sub-goal instead of following the SLMC --> believed to: better overview, prerequisites -> important


% starting point
The 7-layer-model provides a detailed roadmap for the design of collaboration systems that allows for the separation of concerns and thus minimizes cognitive overload. While it is focused on the design phase, it is not conclusive nor specifically designed for the development of a citizen science project. Therefore, it is combined with the design and implementation 6-stage-cycle specifically addressing Crowdsourcing projects. Furthermore, practical guidelines from other projects and a literature review are also considered.

The design and implementation cycle was specifically developed as a toolkit that "provides five basic process steps for planning, designing and carrying out a crowdsourcing or citizen science project" (https://www.citizenscience.gov/toolkit/#). This toolkit gives a great overall framework for the development of a citizen science project, but lacks specifications in the design stage. In this work is applied twofold. First, it embeds the seven-layer model in a crowdsensing project development framework precisely designed for this purpose and secondly it provides a good overview about all stages, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of other citizen science projects. 


The 7-Layer Model of Collaboration can add additional (more detailed) guidance specifically in the design phase. Thus, the 7-Layer Model is the primary, in detail guide, while the 5-stages-cycle embeds this into the larger context of the full life cycle of such a development.
Besides these methodological frameworks, tangible guidelines based on other projects experiences are also integrated into the design phase as focal points to which additional attention is paid in the process.

Nonetheless there are areas were both systems overlap. The first stage of the 5-stage-cycle e.g. overlaps with the first 'goal' layer of the 7-layer-model and the fifth stage aligns with the 5th,6th, and 7th layer. While these overlaps may exist, they do not contradict each other but just highlight the importance of those aspects also in later stages of the citizen science project.

what about dimensions: economic, political, social, cognitive, physical, and technical dimensions
--> all play into this project but to different degrees. Focus here is on the network, process and technical dimension on how to implement such a citizen science project in a resource scarce environment
%% not sure.. needs some more thinking.. fliegt raus. Ist zu viel und nicht nötig.
While this gives the work a well founded methodological base, it is primarily based on the perspective of a process focussed understanding/thinking of the design phase. Other perspectives like the ones of resource, behavioral network / stakeholder, value network and culture, as well as the communication network perspective may come into play in certain aspects but are of secondary nature in this work.

--> these perspectives accompany specifically the design process in the 7-layer-model - encouraging a more holistic view of the design.




% multiple-case studies --> the more the better --> this is just the beginning of a pilot case
- exploratory studies for discovering relevant constructs in areas where theory building is at the formative stages
understanding complex processes involving multiple participants and interacting sequences of events in one setting
-> single if constraints -> mmultiple case studies, better generalisable


% there will alwys be problems with case studies.. reality is just no laboratory
"No matter the extent of scientific rigour, consultation and planning, unexpected obstacles will inevitably emerge during field research, and these will require adaptive strategies to be overcome. In particular, conducting survey research in remote rural areas of the developing world may pose unique challenges that require appropriate context-relevant responses. Unfortunately, text books and the current body of scientific papers do little to equip researchers for the experience that awaits them. Obtaining trust and buy-in from key gatekeepers, overcoming logistics difficulties, effectively developing local skills and managing staff relocation are some fieldwork aspects that may be particularly trying when working in deep rural settings."

problems and challenges are inevitable but addressing them in a timely and effective manner seems to be of high importance. (https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-4505-11-14)


" In particular, we realised the importance of a strong local partnership, based on mutual respect, clear agreed goals of collaboration and shared development interests [26, 27], but also the willingness and honesty to question decisions and discuss alternative approaches."



“. However, the drawback of a single-case design is its inability to provide a generalising conclusion, in particular when the events are rare.” ([Zainal, 2007, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/E7AYTQ3N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XVAZ2W6C?page=2&annotation=L3Z4EIY8))

(e.g. everything always had to be approved by the red cross.. super slow, extremely unreliable, many tries, no results)

In the context of this project, interviews should always be initiated and supported by either the GRC or the FbF project manager at SCRS, but there was no response even after several requests. Further limited by the time constraints of this work and previous complications, it was not possible to conduct further interviews as part of this work. Nevertheless, due to the iterative methodology building up over time, valuable insights could be gained with each of the interviews. 

--> very tense situation in Somaliland -> time constraints are completely understandable

Other research types such as experimental research, desk or field surveys and survey research all have their inherent strengths and weaknesses, but none lends itself as well to exploratory, in-depth and contextual analysis to create a roadmap as case study research does \autocite{pelzResearchMethodsSocial}.

“proof-of-concept research to demonstrate the functional feasibility of a solution; proof-of-value research to investigate whether a solution can create value across a variety of conditions; and proof-of-use research” ([Nunamaker et al., 2015, p. 0](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/Y8BXIHDQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/C8VM8EY8?page=1&annotation=3BBX7DN9))

single-case design (could be extended through future studies)
Exploratory research is furthermore an effective tool to lay groundwork for future studies.

% and how I could address those
5 typical errors (Benbasat et al. (1987)) Benbasat, I., Goldstein, D. K., and Mead, M. (1987). “The Case Research Strategy in Studies of Information Systems,” MIS Quarterly (11:3), 369-386.
research studies start without specific research questions --> end up without any specific answers or insightful inferences
case sites aree often chosen based on access and convenience, rather than based on the fit with the research question --> no adequate address of the RQ
often no validation or triangulation of data collected using multiple means --> leads to biased interpretation based on responsen from biased interviewees.
very little provision of how data was collected (interview questions, which documents er examined, positions of interviewees, etc.) or analyzed --> doubts about the reliability
often not as longitudinal research method but only cross-sectional with limited views of processes and phenomena that are temporal in nature


"Advantages of Exploratory Research

    Lower costs of conducting the study
    Flexibility and adaptability to change
    Exploratory research is effective in laying the groundwork that will lead to future studies.
    Exploratory studies can potentially save time by determining at the earlier stages the types of research that are worth pursuing

Disadvantages of Exploratory Research

    Inclusive nature of research findings
    Exploratory studies generate qualitative information and interpretation of such type of information is subject to bias
    These types of studies usually make use of a modest number of samples that may not adequately represent the target population. Accordingly, findings of exploratory research cannot be generalized to a wider population.
    Findings of such type of studies are not usually useful in decision making in a practical level."

% pros and cons
intense studying of a phenomenon within its natural setting in one or few sites. data collection --> interviews, observations, prerecorded documents and secondary data. (trochim)+
-> rich, detailed, contextualized
strength: 
- either theory testing or theory building
- research question can be adjusted on the go
- richer, more contextualized and more authentic interpretation o the phenomenon of interest -> capture rich information specific for that site/context
- multiple perspectives as multiple participants can be interviewed to the same topics

“the detailed qualitative accounts often produced in case studies not only help to explore or describe the data in real-life environment, but also help to explain the complexities of reallife situations which may not be captured through experimental or survey research.” ([Zainal, 2007, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/E7AYTQ3N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XVAZ2W6C?page=4&annotation=TYRDUNIQ))

%%%%% 7 Layer model
The \acrfull{slmc} was created primarily with group collaboration in mind and is not geared towards \acrshort*{cs} projects. The specific methods and techniques of the model are aimed at the collaboration of groups, but the overall pattern can be applied to designs in other contexts as well.

% in regard to prc
Don't integrate in stage 1 \& 2 --> no bias/not limit into the exploration phase and feasibility phase --> project requirements are for the design, and not for the exploration stage or feasibility assessment in stage 2.

% important: name the mapping campaign! planned as SRCS staff -> educated personal, no rookies, no volunteers.
% biases.. important? mention? discussion? possibly discussion. Have fun old me!

% -> Innovation -> it is believed, that every context is special and that some sort of adjustments and innovations must be made every time - varying extend but nonetheless (not many papers talked about this though)
% foundation: transition of CBS --> no CBS without thorough embeddedness into the context with a good and well laid out basis - policy development is somewhat in between innovation and foundation. but e.g. the framework of Day 2009 lies a good foundation for this -> though, not that new and many IWRM concepts exist as well. Though, as already discussed, often way too complicated to be applicable in practice --> Day found to be extensive but also limited enough to be realisable.
% knowledge, gathers everything that needs to be known for the entire project. Is answered across all stages 
% management -> what the goal is: initial and regular information gathering --> good to know what the knowledge is needed for

% while multiple other frameworks and guidelines already exist, their numrous number is also explained/reflected by the need, that the frameworks need to be focussed on a specific topic, region and environment in order to give meaningful advice and not only generic information that is too coarse to be of great use. Therefore, -> new development and adjustments --> fraisl was e.g. focused on environmental and ecological stuff, CBS was too heavy on the social side e.g. patient privacy and case handling is way less important in this case

(A1) evaluation practices have been thought of in every stage and the integration of feedback loops has been mentioned in every phase. (A2) \acrshortpl{aa} were presented in section \ref*{subsubsec:assemblage} together with respective thresholds and triggers. As with the data for triangulation purposes and data management procedures, the final decision will be made by to the overall \acrshort{eap} development team. (A3)

(A) specification and implementation of processes and activities
(B) Specification of processes of regular activities
(C) Specification of the embedding process

The combination of both mechanisms (short and seasonal) might be the best choice for the creation of a staggered trigger.

The trigger will follow the overall trigger methodology of the \acrshort{eap} and

method: generally: coded SMS

% I1.2
-	Water levels in berkeds could be a good indicator, however it cannot be a stand alone indicator. This has to be combined by meteorological forecasts and local knowledge as well.
- Regarding Anticipatory actions, there has been any actions yet due to the fact that there is no water monitoring and trigger mechanism in place.


with preceding procedures including awareness raising, public education, policy development and method improvements determined and accomplished now proceed to the actual mapping task of Berkeds.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I1.2
- WATER QUALITY
Water quality is difficult to monitor at community level as it is a technical activity. Unless if the SRCS through the branch staff are equipped with water testing equipment as well as training them on the water parameters to be tested.
+ not aware of any feasible water quality tests on the ground.. (should be further investigated though..)




% recommended to combine the BRCiS appraoch with I1 categorization. one more extensive long-term assessment at the end of the rain season together with the other rarely changing indicators (e.g. number of animals and people) but also combined with an triangulation with stakeholder and thorough analysis and interpretation of data --> integration into decision-making processes. --> seasonal warning and identification of vulnerability + short-term facilitation of immediate action with the short-term water level warnings


% regular reporting with event based reporting as water in Berkads can e.g. dry up quicker than predicted or turn bad or what ever else..

- BRCiS: "Cash transfers were "identified across several clusters as the preferred action" where local markets and the operational context allow" (TB) --> but only there and market prices are very high when drought sets in
--> Beledi highlights help throughout the society -> but water prices rise very high.. 


- better comparison between the comparable projects of NADFOR, MoWR and OCHA was not possible due to lack of raw data --> no interviews

% I1
-results for the implementation of AAs:
o	i) Determining the water level to trigger action
o	ii) water levels monitoring

(104) MoH has good experiences with NYSS in the health sector. These experiences should be translated and widened on other topics.

There are three main types of water resources monitoring, used in the water resources management system:
%% main points:
local monitoring, performed for solution of specific local problems on a limited part of the water body or the territory;
global (background) monitoring, performed at man-impact free sites, or on sites with low level of anthropogenic influence. Such monitoring is performed for acquisition of information on steady natural characteristics of environmental components. The background monitoring of water bodies is used for evaluation and/or prognostication of shifts in their state caused by economic activities;
comprehensive (regime) monitoring performed at the water body observation network for determination of the actual state of the water body, for decision making on efficient use, protection, and restoration of water resources;
critical or alarm monitoring, performed at sites of high risk for immediate warning about unfavourable situations caused primarily by human activities.
In the water management system there is also a special type of monitoring for wastewater discharges to the water body."https://echo2.epfl.ch/VICAIRE/mod_4/chapt_5/main.htm

"As a rule, the following parameters are always monitored:

Water Temperature.
Transparency or Turbidity.
pH.
Conductivity.
Dissolved oxygen (DO).
Total phosphorus.
Total nitrogen.
Nitrogen, Ammonia.
Nitrogen, Nitrate.
Soluble Reactive Phosphorus.
Faecal coliform bacteria." https://echo2.epfl.ch/VICAIRE/mod_4/chapt_5/main.htm

“Within these citizen science projects, monitoring mainly focuses on rivers (48%) but also considers lakes (26%), groundwater (12.57%), and estuaries (13.33%)” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=4&annotation=QGL5N2BA))
% while there are lots of hydrological monitoring stuff out there (mostly crowdsensing in the case of water + focused on health by CBS), there is none, that looks at drinking water source monitoring direktly by applying the proven sets of methods on a new topic in a new environment (not North America but resource scarce environments from the perspective of an NGO (SRCS)) 
“Citizen scientists measure physical (34.22%, e.g., temperature, turbidity, color), chemical (34.76%, e.g., pH, nitrates, phosphates, dissolved oxygen), biological (22.99%, e.g., fecal coliform bacteria, algae, aquatic macroinvertebrates), and some other parameters (8.02%, e.g., macro/microplastic pollution, riparian habitat), demonstrating the diverse tasks citizen scientists engage in. Citizen scientists further measure these parameters rather ‘regularly’ (82.93%) than ‘sometimes only’ (17.07%), indicating continuity and thus a substantial contribution of citizens to the monitoring process.” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=4&annotation=6GC8UE8I))

% from case study EAP stuff --> here is interesting, that the largest aka the ballay (open reservoir) may be the largest, though definitely not the one which holds water for the longest time.. so not a very good trigger + berkads are often build in clusters, making an average of these more important + no ownership -> access is not observed.. shitty shit shit.
For example, the condition of the primary water source is assessed at the end of rainy season and based on its water level categorized into normal (more than half-full [75\%] or full), alert (half-full [50\%]) or alert (less than half-full [25\%] or empty).

\section{Main Section 2}

There is a need for research exploring if marginalized perspectives are excluded in crowdsourcing and self-reporting approaches, the recall bias and measurement error in self-reporting (Bell et al. 2019), and if incentives, memory triggers, or other mechanisms can be used to address these issues.

etc. not really mentioned but have huge potential to improve all of this. Big question is HOW!

% thus nice in theory, but not useful in practice
% in regard to drought and water scarcity
% and while there is an extensive body of literature about these topics, the minor details are not of great interest to this work but the general conclusion, that physical, large scale drought or water scarcity indicators do not capture the required level of detail and impact that is needed to operationally act upon. Also, while the complexity of these concepts is due to the level of complexity of the surveyed phenomenon, its application and comparison is hindered. Thus a method to assess local impact, that builds and incorporates these concepts in a practically applicable manner is needed to adequately address this detrimental topic. 

% self surveying is generally not recommended:
“Indeed, collecting data on local indicators would require from the national society a team of enumerators that work continually to collect and process that information in all places where the program could possibly trigger (e.g. collect food price information for every village market). This would have extensive cost implications and likely over-burden the national society staff and volunteers.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=2YIIK6ZY))

“As such, the inclusion of local indicators into an FbA trigger must involve assessing what indicators are relevant for the impacts the program is trying to anticipate and identify which of those indicators are already collected (e.g. the ministry of agriculture's food price bulletin) and are available at the time they would be needed to inform a possible trigger.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=7X3RFGVB))


% --> thus - monthly review of users is necessary
“In a region where migration is one of the main coping mechanisms for drought, a targeted survey focusing on the early detection of migration movements would help mobilize the timely allocation of resources by humanitarian decision-makers or even the mitigation of drought impacts.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1167](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=7&annotation=N9FRDA9C))



% keeping data up to date is crucial in ensuring correct vulnerability and exposure data 
“Vulnerability and exposure changes over time, particularly after an extreme weather or climate event. Datasets must be kept up to date to ensure the impact-based forecast or warning using this data is reliable. Recognise that many official governmental data sources, such as a national census or demographic and health surveys, are updated infrequently – every five or ten years.” ([Harrowsmith et al., 2020, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QJ397Y54)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2GS362N5?page=28&annotation=5XVAQCTY))

was considered, but was discarded at a very early stage. The very limited reliability, completeness and actuality of the available data sets had already been reviewed and stated by the project team before the start of this work. This lack of data was the reason for this work, but a short analysis was able to confirm these statements and thus, due to relevance and time constraints, 
% zweiter Teil noch nicht im Methodenteil genannt
the focus was more on the design to create exactly such data sets for further analyses. This can be seen as a limitation, but can also be another reason to do exactly this work."

\subsection{Limitations}
“Citizen science has several limitations, including the wide range of required skills outside the research subject, sustaining engagement, biases related to data collection and analysis, sensor calibration issues and varying data privacy regulations around the world, among others.” ([Fraisl et al., 2022, p. 13](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/FBJD7SWS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7WBDKYDY?page=13&annotation=WNQZRHRF))




Besides the already mentioned limitations of the case study research type limited time and no possibility to be on site limited the possibilities. The dependence on specific people to initiate and allow each interview complicated and prolonged an already complex situation. Combined with the understandably limited time of SRCS staff, who were already stressed by the acute response to the current drought, this resulted in few interviews.
