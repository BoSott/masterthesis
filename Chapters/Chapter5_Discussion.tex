% discussion:
% read some guidelines mate. just read some guidelines. Bed time. can't think anymore.
% last big chapter! Woop Woop!!
% discuss context e.g. water security, water scarcity and drought
% discuss FbF and CS

\textbf{!!!!!!!!!!!!!STAY FOCUSSED on the discussion, do not iterate over everything !!!!!!!!!!}
% difficult part -> stage 1 and 2 -> those are more or less already discussions in themselves..
-> reread the sections


interpret and explain

elaborate on an evaluate research findings + significance and implications

-> address research questions and hypotheses

--> draw conclusion

evaluate and interpret results
-> focus on stuff that is directly related to the research aim

don't report ANY new findings

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Step 1: restate your research problem, aim, hypotheses and questions
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Climate change
drought
Water security
water scarcity

--> research aim
+ objectives and questions









%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Step 2: summarise your key findings
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% themes and relationships (qualitative) and correlations and causality (quantitative)
% -> highlight overall key findings
% -> one or two paragraphs -> be concise

% e.g.
% The data suggest that…
% The data support/oppose the theory that…
% The analysis identifies…

in the order of the research questions

--> theoretical background 

--> assessment supported feasibility% (in this order? -> that was stage 2, though problem was stage 1... so what ^^) 

--> adapted + newly could be developed framework based on ssf, slmc and others and contextualized with Interviews and comparable local findings (though scarce)

--> application of framework for creating implementation roadmap suggests useful development

% don't think that I want to open that barrel
% e.g. since it can be characterized as 'wicked problem', thorough frameworks are required to guide the development and design phase

% Step 3: interpret your results
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% unpack the findings (no new information!)

% -> follow a similar structure as in the result chapter
% or research questions/hypotheses
% or theoretical framework

% how does those results compare to existing research ?! -> lit review

% contrasts are often the most interesting findings --> why? significant?

% - How do your results relate with those of previous studies?
% - If you get results that differ from those of previous studies, why may this be the case?
% - What do your results contribute to your field of research?
% - What other explanations could there be for your findings?

% don't draw conclusions, that aren't substantiated -> everything need to be backed up by something

... in the light of
While all of these more dedicated indicators may present great value, relatively simple Indices such as the SPEI is not possible for Somalia due to the lack of a good enough weather monitoring network. 


localization of forecasts and so on.. why it is difficult to use SPEI, SPI and so on and others.. --> more data to operationalize is very important, even though it should not be the task of the SRCS --> high costs but a lot of trust in the communities and CBS is also working great.
drought indicator (what exists so far? -> pre study)

-> alternative projects
-> comes out of those -> relates rather good to the current state of art


OCHA and BRCiS are alternative strategies --> overall relevant for the EAP but not directly for this work, too specialized, could also be intergrated. OCHA and BRCiS have different foci

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% !!!CITIZEN SCIENCE !!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% some random piece of text.. maybe recycle, maybe not. Possibly not.
One approach that is fusing the CBM and the MCS approach is Community-based Surveillance (CBM). Thus far, CBM is predominantly used in the context of epidemiology and other health related issues, incorporating mobile messaging applications with on site awareness training and first response knowledge. This community-based management component is seen as the foundation in most of the programs and the following information collection and transmission in terms of the MCS is just regarded as the second step. Nonetheless, this second step can and already did facilitate numerous early preventions and actions in various manners.
%\acrshort*{mcs} has great potential to cover wide areas and even extend monitoring efforts to an entire country, but local conditions must be taken into account to contribute to a successful project outcome\autocite{huangManagementDrinkingWater2020}.

“Citizen Science experiments have demonstrated that at least three issues must be addressed: commitment of people participating in data collection (were social component is key), the validation of data collected and sent by citizens and privacy concerns about the collection of personal information.” ([Alfonso and Jonoski, 2012, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/4W4Q8E6B)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/PU944FGI?page=6\&annotation=LZXCJDFB))

“Indeed, collecting data on local indicators would require from the national society a team of enumerators that work continually to collect and process that information in all places where the program could possibly trigger (e.g. collect food price information for every village market). This would have extensive cost implications and likely over-burden the national society staff and volunteers.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=2YIIK6ZY))
“As such, the inclusion of local indicators into an FbA trigger must involve assessing what indicators are relevant for the impacts the program is trying to anticipate and identify which of those indicators are already collected (e.g. the ministry of agriculture's food price bulletin) and are available at the time they would be needed to inform a possible trigger.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=7X3RFGVB))

% about the slmc
In this work, emphasis is given to the top three layers, the \textit{Goal-, Products-, and Activities-Layer}., firstly due to time and information constraints and secondly as practical applicable methods need to be highly adjusted to the local context. This will further be discussed and outlined in subsequent chapters.

discussion: the SLMC was good until general activities - then: it has to become quite detailed --> not feasible in the scope of this work. but a good framework to continue the work with.

-> sub-sub-activities or products could also be labelled differently.. not all levels were clear and distinct

--> Methods, techniques, tools and scripts need to be created/developed -> therefore sub-goal instead of following the SLMC --> believed to: better overview, prerequisites -> important

%%%%% 7 Layer model
The \acrfull{slmc} was created primarily with group collaboration in mind and is not geared towards \acrshort*{cs} projects. The specific methods and techniques of the model are aimed at the collaboration of groups, but the overall pattern can be applied to designs in other contexts as well. 

"Van Diggelen & Overdijk (2009) noted that although the use of a design pattern may change when it is applied in other domains, the basic concept of the design process will be preserved when applied to other fields." Minkman 2015

% starting point
The 7-layer-model provides a detailed roadmap for the design of collaboration systems that allows for the separation of concerns and thus minimizes cognitive overload. While it is focused on the design phase, it is not conclusive nor specifically designed for the development of a citizen science project. Therefore, it is combined with the design and implementation 6-stage-cycle specifically addressing Crowdsourcing projects. Furthermore, practical guidelines from other projects and a literature review are also considered.

The design and implementation cycle was specifically developed as a toolkit that "provides five basic process steps for planning, designing and carrying out a crowdsourcing or citizen science project" (https://www.citizenscience.gov/toolkit/#). This toolkit gives a great overall framework for the development of a citizen science project, but lacks specifications in the design stage. In this work is applied twofold. First, it embeds the seven-layer model in a crowdsensing project development framework precisely designed for this purpose and secondly it provides a good overview about all stages, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of other citizen science projects. 

The 7-Layer Model of Collaboration can add additional (more detailed) guidance specifically in the design phase. Thus, the 7-Layer Model is the primary, in detail guide, while the 5-stages-cycle embeds this into the larger context of the full life cycle of such a development.
Besides these methodological frameworks, tangible guidelines based on other projects experiences are also integrated into the design phase as focal points to which additional attention is paid in the process.

Nonetheless there are areas were both systems overlap. The first stage of the 5-stage-cycle e.g. overlaps with the first 'goal' layer of the 7-layer-model and the fifth stage aligns with the 5th,6th, and 7th layer. While these overlaps may exist, they do not contradict each other but just highlight the importance of those aspects also in later stages of the citizen science project.

what about dimensions: economic, political, social, cognitive, physical, and technical dimensions
--> all play into this project but to different degrees. Focus here is on the network, process and technical dimension on how to implement such a citizen science project in a resource scarce environment
%% not sure.. needs some more thinking.. fliegt raus. Ist zu viel und nicht nötig.
While this gives the work a well founded methodological base, it is primarily based on the perspective of a process focussed understanding/thinking of the design phase. Other perspectives like the ones of resource, behavioral network / stakeholder, value network and culture, as well as the communication network perspective may come into play in certain aspects but are of secondary nature in this work.

--> these perspectives accompany specifically the design process in the 7-layer-model - encouraging a more holistic view of the design.

-> same procedure by.. 
More examples of \acrshort*{mcs} were compiled and analysed by fraisl and xy
% environmental monitoring --> Zheng 2018 figure 10 and chapter 4 -> quite extensive (weather, air quality, precipitation, geography (VGI), ecology, surface water,) + table 2 overview literature for these

other perspectives than process oriented -> 7-layer model self-critisism (resource, behavioral perspectives, + value and communication network design approaches)

% in regard to prc
Don't integrate in stage 1 \& 2 --> no bias/not limit into the exploration phase and feasibility phase --> project requirements are for the design, and not for the exploration stage or feasibility assessment in stage 2.

% -> Innovation -> it is believed, that every context is special and that some sort of adjustments and innovations must be made every time - varying extend but nonetheless (not many papers talked about this though)
% foundation: transition of CBS --> no CBS without thorough embeddedness into the context with a good and well laid out basis - policy development is somewhat in between innovation and foundation. but e.g. the framework of Day 2009 lies a good foundation for this -> though, not that new and many IWRM concepts exist as well. Though, as already discussed, often way too complicated to be applicable in practice --> Day found to be extensive but also limited enough to be realisable.
% knowledge, gathers everything that needs to be known for the entire project. Is answered across all stages 
% management -> what the goal is: initial and regular information gathering --> good to know what the knowledge is needed for

% while multiple other frameworks and guidelines already exist, their numrous number is also explained/reflected by the need, that the frameworks need to be focussed on a specific topic, region and environment in order to give meaningful advice and not only generic information that is too coarse to be of great use. Therefore, -> new development and adjustments --> fraisl was e.g. focused on environmental and ecological stuff, CBS was too heavy on the social side e.g. patient privacy and case handling is way less important in this case

% Groundwork ist dürftig.. wegen:
Practical pilot test runs of any of the activities summarized under this goal were out of scope of this project and were thus postponed to a later phase. 

% in regard to decision-making in The Management: Mapping \& Monitoring section (stage 3, group 4)

% DESIGN FRAMEWORKS
SSF worked really well - good framework
but: requirements were missing -> complicated to think about everything --> during the course of the work -> too far spread --> development of PRC helped tremendously

stage 1 once a bit redundant to the overall research design, as the problem definition was the reason for this work


SLMC -> only the first three stages. The rest was too detailed and most of those need to be determined in closer collaboration with the team and the local stakeholders. Nonetheless, based on the positive experiences with the first three stages, it is believed that the following layers will also prove fruitful to potential future developments.

PRC
worked well in this context but it also came out of this context so what would one expect..
% reasoning why pcr
as the guidance for requirements of the is relatively scarce for practical application at this stage. 



other guidelines:
hard to keep an overview about everything


“Given the different layers of complexity with drought, different types of triggers may be required beyond what is often used in EAP development. For instance, unconventional triggers for FbA for drought could include metrics such as staple food prices, percentages of crop failure, and other elements of food security early warning systems.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=JZV26DPP))
% --> even the RCRC is still looking for good triggers -> maybe water levels are a good way -> reasoning for this study



% Challenges:
“Challenges and risks have related to: securing free SMS channels for alerts, time required for contextualised design, ensuring response action, and managing expectations of the scope of CBS.” ([Byrne and Nichol, 2020, p. 71](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/R9QNVPU8)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/VFH6JVJS?page=2&annotation=KKVDV6DE))

% war ja so auch nicht ganz richtig.. 
This work has focussed primarily on the stages one to three. as stage 4, community building is not necessary to that extent since the \acrshort*{srcs} already has a vivid network of active and motivated volunteers. The fifth stage, was partly considered, but could not be mainly worked on due to time constraints and unresolved issues in the design phase and as this project did not leave the design phase, a major evaluation in phase 6 was obsolete. % though I did consider those.. see results --> rewrite this section to account for the changes

- BRCiS: "Cash transfers were "identified across several clusters as the preferred action" where local markets and the operational context allow" (TB) --> but only there and market prices are very high when drought sets in
--> Beledi highlights help throughout the society -> but water prices rise very high.. 

-> size of Berkad is detrimental! --> Richard water levels are for a week. Improved ones are for a couple of months --> water level is only one variable! needs to be correlated with the extraction and storage size

% size is important, but quality as well
% from case study EAP stuff --> here is interesting, that the largest aka the ballay (open reservoir) may be the largest, though definitely not the one which holds water for the longest time.. so not a very good trigger + berkads are often build in clusters, making an average of these more important + no ownership -> access is not observed.. shitty shit shit.
For example, the condition of the primary water source is assessed at the end of rainy season and based on its water level categorized into normal (more than half-full [75\%] or full), alert (half-full [50\%]) or alert (less than half-full [25\%] or empty).

"Advantages of Exploratory Research

    Lower costs of conducting the study
    Flexibility and adaptability to change
    Exploratory research is effective in laying the groundwork that will lead to future studies.
    Exploratory studies can potentially save time by determining at the earlier stages the types of research that are worth pursuing

Disadvantages of Exploratory Research

    Inclusive nature of research findings
    Exploratory studies generate qualitative information and interpretation of such type of information is subject to bias
    These types of studies usually make use of a modest number of samples that may not adequately represent the target population. Accordingly, findings of exploratory research cannot be generalized to a wider population.
    Findings of such type of studies are not usually useful in decision making in a practical level."

% pros and cons
intense studying of a phenomenon within its natural setting in one or few sites. data collection --> interviews, observations, prerecorded documents and secondary data. (trochim)+
-> rich, detailed, contextualized
strength: 
- either theory testing or theory building
- research question can be adjusted on the go
- richer, more contextualized and more authentic interpretation o the phenomenon of interest -> capture rich information specific for that site/context
- multiple perspectives as multiple participants can be interviewed to the same topics

% and how I could address those
5 typical errors (Benbasat et al. (1987)) Benbasat, I., Goldstein, D. K., and Mead, M. (1987). “The Case Research Strategy in Studies of Information Systems,” MIS Quarterly (11:3), 369-386.
research studies start without specific research questions --> end up without any specific answers or insightful inferences
case sites aree often chosen based on access and convenience, rather than based on the fit with the research question --> no adequate address of the RQ
often no validation or triangulation of data collected using multiple means --> leads to biased interpretation based on responsen from biased interviewees.
very little provision of how data was collected (interview questions, which documents er examined, positions of interviewees, etc.) or analyzed --> doubts about the reliability
often not as longitudinal research method but only cross-sectional with limited views of processes and phenomena that are temporal in nature

% there will alwys be problems with case studies.. reality is just no laboratory
"No matter the extent of scientific rigour, consultation and planning, unexpected obstacles will inevitably emerge during field research, and these will require adaptive strategies to be overcome. In particular, conducting survey research in remote rural areas of the developing world may pose unique challenges that require appropriate context-relevant responses. Unfortunately, text books and the current body of scientific papers do little to equip researchers for the experience that awaits them. Obtaining trust and buy-in from key gatekeepers, overcoming logistics difficulties, effectively developing local skills and managing staff relocation are some fieldwork aspects that may be particularly trying when working in deep rural settings."

problems and challenges are inevitable but addressing them in a timely and effective manner seems to be of high importance. (https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-4505-11-14)

research type case study (exploratory, complex, in-depth + defined area) -> fitted well
constraints: I was not connected to the case study
external validity: -> little basis for scientific generalisation (\autocites{yinCaseStudyResearch1984}[5]{zainalCaseStudyResearch2007} -> true, future studies but: framework (prc))

internal validity -> prone to bias and subjectivity (good question..)

constructed validity "the extent to which a study investigates what it claims to investigate" \autocite[3]{gibbertWhatPassesRigorous2008} so that "the researcher can correctly evaluate the studied concepts" \autocite[277]{ferreiraHowImproveValidity2020}
addressed by establishing a clear chain of evidence and triangulation of perspectives and sources --> could be done by the frameworks -> only ssf lacked though --> prc to address this


reliability -> extensively documented: but interviews: well.. humans (absence of random error)
enhanced by: clear procedures and good documentation

"Furthermore, case studies are frequently criticized for being excessively long, challenging to execute, and requiring significant documentation efforts \autocite{yinCaseStudyResearch1984}."
--> yeaah welllll true

other research type such as experimental or survey research were not fit for purpose - but: survey research within a pilot study with the communities might be feasible to get some more juicy quantity (but: biases)

justification in the methodology: can be followed

hypothesis could be tested + framework could be developed + applied and tested


exploratory technique + iterative -> nothing else would have worked

% lit analysis
--> lit review and expecially the search was not scientifically structured -> might have missed a point or two

feasible technique - critisism: not standardised but also not the goal of this project -> was more groundwork than the goal itself

scarce literature about Somaliland itself - well notting to change here but name it

data analysis was limited and an indepth machine learning what ever approach might be able to get something out of it but -> project team + this project was based on the insight, that data is shitty. -> discarded
OSM could have been another source.. shitty as fk (-> personal communication project team)

interviews:
expert sampling worked, snowball system as well though both very limited

iterative strategy allowed to get the most out of it as each interview questionnaire could build on the former information

open ended questions were felt as good option. The questionnaire for I1 worked also well and a lot of information was gained through that.

-> + high level interviewees (all project managers)

transcription by Whisper: that worked damn well mate

coding: unaufgeregt und recht gut machbar


% Methods end
--> why only participatory levels (1) and (2) (ssf)


(e.g. everything always had to be approved by the red cross.. super slow, extremely unreliable, many tries, no results)
In the context of this project, interviews should always be initiated and supported by either the GRC or the FbF project manager at SCRS, but there was no response even after several requests. Further limited by the time constraints of this work and previous complications, it was not possible to conduct further interviews as part of this work. Nevertheless, due to the iterative methodology building up over time, valuable insights could be gained with each of the interviews. 
--> very tense situation in Somaliland -> time constraints are completely understandable

% notes from the team

The temporal variations in drought showed decreasing trends in severity and increasing trends in drought duration as the SPEI timescales increas
However, the study was limited by the low security levels in Somalia that makes
the country largely inaccessible. This has complicated possibilities for
ground-truthing available information. Besides, the 1991 civil war in
Somalia led to the collapse of hydro-meteorological monitoring network
(Muchiri, 2007). The current stations established by Food and Agricul-
ture Organization Somalia Water and Land Information Management
(FAO SWALIM) from 2002 do not have uniform spatial distribution
throughout the country and therefore cannot be useful in computing
reference SPE



Nonetheless, it needs to be mentioned, that most indices will always be proxies for other conditions, which can not or only very arduously be measured. 
e.g. “While food security forecasts may be an acceptable means for mobilizing global funding earlier, this does not imply that the underlying crisis is strictly a food security crisis.” ([OCHA, 2020, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/NYQL45SA)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3PG9LF86?page=7&annotation=JD7JZTTN))

“the correlation degree between perception indicators and scientific indicators is high only when considering a direct impact of drought, for example the reduction of productivity for non-irrigated crops.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 540](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=18&annotation=6KRIS4DA))
“Firstly, stakeholders tend to oversimplify the cause-effect chain” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 540](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=18&annotation=IBV34JQL))

“On the other hand, due to the limitations of their viewpoint, stakeholders tend to neglect the existence of multiple causes for certain observed phenomena.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=8CUNSCXS))
“Secondly, the data collected shows that the stakeholders tend to aggregate the variables describing the drought impacts, for example the impacts of crop productivity vary dramatically according to the crop under consideration, whereas stakeholders perceived a general reduction in productivity.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=TT7JRW3U))


% this project cannot stand alone
There are three main types of water resources monitoring, used in the water resources management system:
%% main points:
local monitoring, performed for solution of specific local problems on a limited part of the water body or the territory;
global (background) monitoring, performed at man-impact free sites, or on sites with low level of anthropogenic influence. Such monitoring is performed for acquisition of information on steady natural characteristics of environmental components. The background monitoring of water bodies is used for evaluation and/or prognostication of shifts in their state caused by economic activities;
comprehensive (regime) monitoring performed at the water body observation network for determination of the actual state of the water body, for decision making on efficient use, protection, and restoration of water resources;
critical or alarm monitoring, performed at sites of high risk for immediate warning about unfavourable situations caused primarily by human activities.
In the water management system there is also a special type of monitoring for wastewater discharges to the water body."https://echo2.epfl.ch/VICAIRE/mod_4/chapt_5/main.htm



\subsection{Limitations}

% from the methodology 
Furthermore, case studies are frequently criticized for being excessively long, challenging to execute, and requiring significant documentation efforts \autocite{yinCaseStudyResearch1984}.
-->
it's true. Case studies are difficult and there is a lot to learn.
e.g. case study protocol --> nice to have but how to handle short term changes that srew everything? such as non responding interviewees and so on.. 

% won't of course change everything
% also: impact is based on humans, governance, social patterns and behaviour. Who would have guessed?!

“In humanitarian practice, the term "drought" is often used to refer to some socio-meteorological combination where water shortages produce stress on human and livelihood systems. Droughts are a function of the fragility of human systems, and they become disasters where systems cannot cope with deviations from the hydro-meteorological norm. It has been argued that droughts are particularly devastating when livelihood choices are strongly determined by the climate (e.g. the decision to grow certain crops, or traditional seasonal migration patterns) - for instance, if in a given year, the weather patterns are different than normal, those livelihoods are especially vulnerable to these changes. It has also been argued that droughts pose specific challenges to income generating activities marked by low productivity that are not able to take advantage of ‘good years’ in order to provide a buffer during ‘bad years’.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 12](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=12&annotation=C622YWIR))


% funding
Funding is not considered in this work, as it is generally out of scope of a Master Thesis to account for that. This is the task of the project management and should be covered by some grant.



“Citizen science has several limitations, including the wide range of required skills outside the research subject, sustaining engagement, biases related to data collection and analysis, sensor calibration issues and varying data privacy regulations around the world, among others.” ([Fraisl et al., 2022, p. 13](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/FBJD7SWS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7WBDKYDY?page=13&annotation=WNQZRHRF))

Besides the already mentioned limitations of the case study research type limited time and no possibility to be on site limited the possibilities. The dependence on specific people to initiate and allow each interview complicated and prolonged an already complex situation. Combined with the understandably limited time of SRCS staff, who were already stressed by the acute response to the current drought, this resulted in few interviews.

% data analysis
An in-depth analysis of existing data sets of water source point and feature information was considered, but  discarded after a first assessment. The very limited reliability, completeness and actuality of the available data sets had already been reviewed and stated by the project team before the start of this work. The lack of data was the main reason for this work to start with, and a short analysis via QGIS3 was able to confirm these statements.

The very limited reliability, completeness and actuality of the available data sets had already been reviewed and stated by the project team before the start of this work.
