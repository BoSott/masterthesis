"Stronger accountability: Data can communicate that work is being done and progress is happening. Data can enable greater transparency, which reduces inefficiency and corruption.
Attracting commitment and investments: Data can quantify problems and make it easier to communicate needs for political commitment and public and private investments.
Evidence-based decision-making: Data can inform policy- and decision-makers of where to focus efforts and which solutions are most effective, to ensure the greatest possible gains with existing resources.
Leaving no one behind: Disaggregated data can help identify specific groups or areas with unmet needs and higher levels of risk, to which interventions can be targeted."

“Experts in trigger methodology have indicated a more appropriate strategy may be to build on tools that currently exist at the government level such as national drought monitoring systems. As such, the ideal is an iterative process with the ground level along with a technology push that creates new ways to analyse drought and drought risk.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=28&annotation=977VS8FC))

drought:



drought frequency


drought severity
Drought severity and drought magnitude are two different aspects of drought that are often used to describe the severity and extent of drought conditions.

Drought severity refers to the intensity of a drought and is typically characterized by the degree to which it affects various aspects of the natural and social systems, such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, streamflow, water supply, agriculture, and socio-economic activities. Severity can be described using qualitative or quantitative measures, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), or the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI).

On the other hand, drought magnitude refers to the overall size or extent of a drought event, typically measured in terms of its spatial and temporal coverage. Magnitude can be characterized by the duration, frequency, and spatial extent of the drought, and can be assessed using various indices, such as the Percentage of Normal (PN) or the Area-Weighted Precipitation Anomaly (AWPA).

In summary, drought severity focuses on the intensity and impacts of a drought event, while drought magnitude describes the overall size and extent of the drought event. Both severity and magnitude are important for understanding and assessing the severity of drought conditions and their impacts on various natural and social systems.

though, duration plays a role in severity as well


drought intensity


impact

“Drought impact Impact of drought on socio-economic systems (sometimes called “socio-economic drought”) and/or ecosystems Aridity Long-term dryness as feature of climate, with long-term average precipitation being much lower than potential evaporation Water scarcity Long-term imbalance between water demand and water supply, caused by high average demand, low average water availability and/or problems with water supply Water shortage/stress Acute lack of water for (social, economic, or environmental) needs, caused by lower water supply than demand Overexploitation Long-term overuse of water resources resulting in a gradual decrease in water availability (for overexploitation of groundwater, the term “depletion” is often used)” ([Van Loon et al., 2016, p. 3637](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/T6SI6L68)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7GTQ4QHT?page=7&annotation=SNJLBYFL))

"what is the difference between drought severity and drought intensity?
Drought severity and drought intensity are two different but related concepts used to describe the magnitude and impact of a drought event.

Drought severity refers to the extent of the impact of a drought on various sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and socioeconomic activities. It is usually assessed by looking at the degree of damage or loss caused by the drought. The severity of a drought is typically measured using indicators such as crop yield reduction, water supply depletion, and economic losses.

Drought intensity, on the other hand, refers to the duration and magnitude of the deficit in precipitation that causes the drought. It is usually assessed by looking at the degree of deviation from normal precipitation patterns and how long it has persisted. The intensity of a drought is typically measured using indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) or the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI).

To illustrate the difference between drought severity and drought intensity, consider a scenario where two regions experience the same precipitation deficit over a period of three months. In the first region, the drought leads to a 50\% reduction in crop yields and widespread water shortages, while in the second region, the drought has little impact on agriculture and water resources. In this case, the severity of the drought is higher in the first region, despite the same intensity of precipitation deficit in both regions.

In summary, drought severity and intensity are both important measures of drought, but they represent different aspects of the phenomenon. Severity relates to the impact of a drought on different sectors, while intensity relates to the magnitude and duration of the precipitation deficit causing the drought \autocite{rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

how does drought severity, drought impact and risk relate to each other?

Drought severity, drought impact, and drought risk are interrelated concepts used to assess and understand the effects of drought on various sectors. Here's how they relate to each other:

Drought severity refers to the degree of impact of a drought event on various sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and socioeconomic activities. It is usually assessed by looking at the degree of damage or loss caused by the drought. Severity can be measured using indicators such as crop yield reduction, water supply depletion, and economic losses.

Drought impact refers to the direct and indirect effects of drought on different sectors of society. It can include effects on human health, wildlife, ecosystems, infrastructure, and the economy. Drought impact can be assessed using various indicators and methods, including surveys, monitoring, and modeling.

Drought risk, on the other hand, is the likelihood of a drought event occurring in a given area and the potential consequences of that event. It takes into account the severity and impact of past droughts, as well as the vulnerability of the affected region to drought. Drought risk can be assessed using various indicators such as climate patterns, soil moisture levels, and water demand.

In summary, drought severity and impact are measures of the magnitude and effects of a drought event, while drought risk is a measure of the likelihood and potential consequences of future droughts. Understanding the relationship between these concepts is important for developing effective drought management strategies, including early warning systems, drought preparedness plans, and mitigation measures. By assessing the severity, impact, and risk of droughts, policymakers, and stakeholders can make informed decisions to reduce the negative effects of drought on society and the environment.

difference between drought severity and drought impact
Drought severity and drought impact are two related but distinct concepts used to measure the magnitude and effects of droughts.

Drought severity refers to the degree of intensity of a drought event. It is typically assessed by looking at the extent of the precipitation deficit, the duration of the drought, and the level of dryness in the affected area. Severity can be measured using various indices such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) or the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Drought severity is a measure of the physical characteristics of a drought event and is not directly related to the effects of the drought on various sectors.

Drought impact, on the other hand, refers to the direct and indirect effects of a drought on different sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and socioeconomic activities. It is usually assessed by looking at the degree of damage or loss caused by the drought, such as crop failure, reduced water availability, and economic losses. Drought impact is a measure of the consequences of the drought on various sectors and is not directly related to the physical characteristics of the drought event.

To illustrate the difference between drought severity and impact, consider a scenario where two regions experience the same severity of drought event, with similar precipitation deficits and dryness levels. In the first region, the drought leads to a 50\% reduction in crop yields, while in the second region, the drought has little impact on agriculture. In this case, the severity of the drought is the same in both regions, but the impact is higher in the first region due to the greater damage to crops.

In summary, drought severity and impact are both important measures of drought, but they represent different aspects of the phenomenon. Severity relates to the physical characteristics of the drought event, while impact relates to the consequences of the drought on various sectors. Understanding the difference between these concepts is crucial for developing effective drought management strategies and mitigation measures. (ChatGPT)

%	SECTION 2 Water security, drought & water scarcity/quality/access
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\section{some other title Drought \& Water security} % irgendwas in Richtung grundlegende Konzepte oder so.. was weiß ich ^^

Water security is a theoretical construct that has emerged in the 21st century to frame the overall water objectives and goals to guide local to global water management and policy development \autocite{sadoffWaterSecurity2020a}. It "links together the web of food, energy, climate, economic growth, and human security challenges that the world economy faces over the next two decades" \autocite[5]{wefBubbleCloseBursting2009}. In more detail, it is about "the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods, ecosystems and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks to people, environments and economies."\autocite{greySinkSwimWater2007}.
Water security integrates therefore economic, social and environmental dimensions into an interconnected and complex system of human and natural relations by addressing risks of too much, too little or poor quality water \autocite{vanbeekWaterSecurityPutting2014, mishraWaterSecurityChanging2021}. Due to the focus of this work, emphasis is placed on factors that decrease water security due to too little water availability. Besides other factors, natural disasters such as droughts, and water scarcity are the main drivers for insufficient quantities of water \autocite{caretta2022water}. Water quality and access are briefly addressed in addition to provide a more comprehensive  understanding of water security for the following chapters.

\subsection{About Drought}\label{subsec:about_drought}

\todo{TODO: change NDMC sources to knew ones}

Drought as highly complex and severe climate-related multi-hazard has far reaching, cascading and interconnected consequences affecting natural ecosystems, societies and economies \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. Historically, droughts are a recurring feature that can occur in all climates. They can geographically extend over small areas to entire sub-continents and are slow onset events that can persist for a few weeks to several years. These high spatial and temporal variabilities make drought not only challenging to define but due to its slow onset, droughts are often only recognized when they are well advanced \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. While some drought conditions over large areas can be associated to some low-frequency changes in atmospheric conditions such as the El Niño, accurate cause identification can be rather challenging on smaller scales and requires many different parameters \autocite{botaiAnalysisDroughtProgression2019, vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

% possibly include after the second sentence also adjust the first one or two sentences of the paragraph below
% in the sense of.. As can be seen in fígure xy, drought is a complex conglomeration of interrelated causes and effects,which makes definition of droughts a fairly mulit-layered undertaking.
% noice figurrrrreee
%“Figure 1.6. Schematic representation of potential interconnections among different sectors affected by droughts” ([“Special report on drought 2021”, 2021, p. 47](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RAAM9PVS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7AK5QVBL?page=49&annotation=TNA9J8ZS))


%In order to approach this complexity, drought is most often defined from four different perspectives, focussing on different manifestations and stages. These definitions are outlined in the coming sub-chapter \ref*{subsec:drought_definitions}, followed by a section addressing the necessary indicators  currently employed in practice for these definitions.
%Generally, droughts are commonly characterized by deviations or the complete failure of climate and weather systems that drive the hydrological cycle compared to normal conditions\autocite{botaiAnalysisDroughtProgression2019,idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. A more in depth definition can be found in the sub-chapter \ref*{subsec:drought_definitions}.

%“Many studies characterize drought via three main aspects: (i) intensity, (ii) duration and (iii) spatial coverage (He et al.,2018;Adede et al.,2019;Dai,2011).” ([Balti et al., 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/V9YH9QFQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/JC4XTVWE?page=3&annotation=WPTV8SEV))
%instead of the first sentence: This complex concept of drought commonly encompassing .... dimensions of interrelated causes ... 

The concept of drought commonly encompasses multiple temporal, spatial and thematic dimensions. This complex conglomeration of interrelated causes and effects makes definition of \textit{droughts} a fairly multi-layered undertaking \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013}. Several well-known definitions (in this category) are for example from the \autocite{theamericanheritagedictionaryoftheenglishlanguageDrought2022} defining drought as "a long period of abnormally low rainfall, especially one that adversely affects growing or living conditions". \autocite[2]{palmerMeteorologicalDrought1965} defines drought as "a prolonged and abnormal moisture deficiency." or \autocite{vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016} defines droughts simply as "an exceptional lack of water compared to normal conditions". Other drought definitions emphasize its natural and/or human origin, its special characteristics, impact and temporal duration or even understand "drought as a system of causality where the link between causes and effects is random in nature {balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020, idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,loonDroughtAnthropocene2016, wangPropagationDroughtMeteorological2016, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. Already in the 1980s, \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985} found more than 150 published definitions of drought. Besides the categorization into a conceptual or operational category , \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985} proposed a clustering of these definitions into four types, namely meteorological drought, agricultural drought, hydrological drought and socio-economic drought. This classification is still widespread today \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

The conceptual category refers to a general formulation of an idea of drought to understand its concept and identify its boundaries and is often formulated in relative terms \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. Definitions in the operational category try to define how drought functions in terms of its onset, duration, severity and spatial coverage also covering how this can be measured via indices \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, nationaldroughtmitigationcenterWhatDrought, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. With these definitions, the current situation is usually compared to a historical average, which is usually based on a 30-year period, which presupposes the development and continuous measurement of indicators and indices that can be used. \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The four types of drought are commonly conceptually defined and brought into practice by operational specifications. They can be understood as different, but complementary stages of the same process and are generally cascading in reason and time but can overlap and are difficult to completely unravel. Figure \todo{TODO:, see https://drought.unl.edu/Education/DroughtIn-depth/TypesofDrought.aspx} shows an overview about the different types, their succession and cascading elements and table \todo{TODO: see RCRC 2020 p.11} displays the four types at a glance.

\missingfigure{https://drought.unl.edu/Education/DroughtIn-depth/TypesofDrought.aspx}

The \textit{meteorological drought} is usually characterized by the duration and the degree of dryness in comparison to the normal average amount and try to conceptually understand how weather patterns can impact water availability. These definitions are specific for a regions atmospheric conditions, e.g. regions with a year-round precipitations regime such as tropical rainforest need different definitions and thresholds than e.g. climates characterized by seasonal rainfall patterns \autocite{nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought}. Operational categorization mostly involves using precipitation, moisture, temperature and wind indicators to determine the onset, severity, and duration of the drought.

\textit{Agricultural drought} definitions establish a connection between different features of meteorological drought with their impacts on agriculture. Soil-moisture, differences between actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil water deficits are some of the operationalized indicators for monitoring this type of drought \autocite{baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The type of \textit{hydrological drought} is associated with the impact of meteorological drought on surface or subsurface water resources such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Hydrological drought occurs when these indicators drop below normal levels \autocite{palmerMeteorologicalDrought1965}. The fastest responding indicator of this type of drought is most often the variability of streamflow. The water levels of lakes and groundwater usually lag behind the occurrence of the meteorological or agricultural drought which is why the hydrological drought is often out of phase with the previously mentioned types. The hydrological drought is commonly defined on the basis of watershed or river basin scale \autocite{baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The \textit{socioeconomic drought} differs from the aforementioned types as it can also incorporate features of these types of drought to associate them with the demand and supply of some social or economic good. It therefore relates the impact of all other types of droughts on human population and its various sectors of society such as food security, health, and the economy. It is therefore sometimes also interchangeably used with drought impacts. Operational categorization involves using socioeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates and food prices to assess the severity and duration of the drought \autocite{nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

\missingfigure{This is just a test.}

The shown economic, social and environmental impacts of drought in figure \todo{TODO:} depend on the severity of, and the risk to drought. These three concepts of impact, severity and risk are interrelated concepts used to assess and understand the effects of drought on various sectors.

Thereby, in alignment with the definition of \autocite{vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016} it is the exceptional severity of the water shortage that distinguishes drought from aridity, a ordinarily recurrent or fully dry climate, and from water scarcity as a long-term "supply/demand and natural and/or human-made phenomenon" \autocites[7]{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021, vanClimatologicalRiskDroughts2017}.

Water scarcity, as for water security or drought, is defined in many different ways. The sixth IPCC Assessment Report defines water scarcity broadly as "a mismatch between the demand for fresh water and its availability, quantified in physical terms" \autocite[560]{caretta2022water}. Here, social and economic components are outsourced to the broader concept of water security and insecurity, focussing primarily on physical water scarcity \autocite{caretta2022water}. In contrast, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations defines water scarcity as "a gap between available supply and expressed demand of freshwater in a specified domain, under prevailing institutional arrangements (including both resource ‘pricing’ and retail charging arrangements) and infrastructural conditions" \autocite[5]{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012} further summarizing that water security is "an excess of water demand over available supply" \autocite[6]{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012}. Thus, highlighting the human dimension of this interactive and relative concept of physical and economic water scarcity. Hereby, physical water scarcity refers to a situation in which there is not enough water available in quantitative terms to meet demand whereas economic water scarcity occurs when inadequate infrastructure, institutional or financial capital obstructs access to water resources "even though water in nature is available to meet human demands" \autocites{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}[11]{moldenWaterFoodWater2007}.

Nonetheless, following the definition of \autocite{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012} the concept of water scarcity always gives water shortage, understood as absolute lack of water in the current situation, a human dimension in particular on the demand side. Here, the quality of policies, planning and management is considered as critical to the overall severity of the impact of water scarcity \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,faoCopingWaterScarcity2012,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. The supply side can be influenced by human activities, but it is not a mandatory prerequisite. \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}. 
Besides the already mentioned water scarcity on the basis of physical quantity and economical factors, water scarcity can also be caused by water of unacceptable quality and lack of access to water services \autocite{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012}. The recognition that insufficient water quality is an additional contributing factor to water scarcity is a relatively recent development in the literature \autocite{liuThreedimensionalWaterScarcity2020} but together with inadequate access highlights further challenges in ensuring water security \autocite{caretta2022water, mishraWaterSecurityChanging2021}.

\subsection{Water Quality \& Access}
% + evtl. human health related water borne diseases and CBS

As could be seen in the previous chapter, besides the quantitative availability of water, its accessibility and quality are crucial. Inadequate water quality can be related to numerous health and environmental issues and can further limit the availability of water for given uses \autocite{rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020, faoCopingWaterScarcity2012}. Unlike the previous concepts, water quality has mostly fixed indicators by which the condition can be determined but historically, and still today, water quality assessment is primarily carried out in laboratories with preceding water sampling activities. This procedure not only makes the determination of water quality a laborious and costly process, but also places high demands on equipment and personnel, so that it is not sufficient for large-scale rural assessments. \autocite{tariqOpenSourceWater2021,worldmeteorologicalorganizationPlanningWaterqualityMonitoring2013}. While simpler methods for in situ water quality monitoring exist, they are either insufficient or often still need to much investment and knowledge to conduct for widespread and frequent monitoring \autocite{worldmeteorologicalorganizationPlanningWaterqualityMonitoring2013}. Nonetheless, new solutions are being developed to simplify and scale affordable water quality assessments to rural areas e.g. \autocite{ighaloComprehensiveReviewWater2020,tariqOpenSourceWater2021}. While the direct assessment of water quality might be challenging, poor water quality can be linked to other factors. Environmental awareness, poor sanitation and hygiene conditions of people in rural areas were for example considered as major causes for contamination of water at the source \autocite{zamxakaMicrobiologicalPhysicochemicalAssessment2004}.

The definition of water access is again a rather challenging undertaking. The \autocite[254]{worldbankWorldDevelopmentReport1997} defined water access in rural areas by "access implies members of the household do not have to spend a disproportionate part of the day fetching water." While both time and distance still play a crucial role in literature when investigating water access \autocite{cassiviDrinkingWaterAccessibility2019,cassiviEvaluatingSelfreportedMeasures2021,emenikeAccessingSafeDrinking2017}, the term also gained a social component \autocite{emenikeAccessingSafeDrinking2017,mitlinUnaffordableUndrinkable}. \autocite{obeng-odoomAccessWater2012} adds four additional factors namely, affordability, quality, equitable distribution to the definition of water access to fully understand if users have access to water in daily live. \autocite{unitednations/developmentprogrammeDeepeningDemocracyFragmented2002} links these parameters to the access to an improved water source which should provide safe drinking water.
The access to improved water sources is therefore generally considered as crucial in the reaching of water security \autocite{cdcAssessingAccessWater2022}. Proactive measures to drought and water scarcity can not only potentially minimize or even neutralize impacts and are considerably more cost-efficient, early warning and anticipatory actions for drought and water scarcity impacts become ever more important \autocite{faoandun-waterProgressLevelWater2021,idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,worldbankHighDryClimate2016}.

\subsection{indicators with risk/vulnerability, indices and impact} % yeah well... choose another title.

Indicators and Indices are often used to translate complex matters into easier to explain numbers and scales that can be measured, tracked and reasonably compared \autocite{blauveltSystematizingEnvironmentalIndicators2014,williamsUsingIndicatorsExplain2017}. This can range from capturing simple measurements to complex and detailed issues that can not only depict ecological conditions but its interactions with societies \autocite{blauveltSystematizingEnvironmentalIndicators2014,mishraWaterSecurityChanging2021}. Indicators and Indices can thus establish a clear and common understanding of a concept or parts of it in a quantifiable and more objective way.
Here, an indicator is understood as a measurable parameter that provides information on the state or trend of an issue or problem. It can be a physical, chemical, biological, or socio-economic variable, such as temperature, soil moisture or streamflow and can be measured locally or remotely. An Index is a composite measure that aggregates multiple indicators into a single value or score \autocite{unitednationsuniversityTooManyIndicators2017,williamsUsingIndicatorsExplain2017, svobodaHandbookDroughtIndicators2016}. Indices are commonly developed on regional or national level to account for the specific circumstances \autocite{unitednationsuniversityTooManyIndicators2017}. This case specification, together with different measurement and aggregation methods, partial inconsistency of definitions and differently focussed objectives on qualitative, quantitative, risk or impact scenarios can constrain their practical application and intercomparability \autocite{svobodaHandbookDroughtIndicators2016,unitednationsuniversityTooManyIndicators2017}. 
Since there is no one definition of drought, water scarcity or security, there is no one best solution to the choice between the many indicators and indices for either of those.



% all indicators are proxies -> good information -> include that somewhere
%“There exist many physical indicators of a drought that are monitored by scientists and governments to track the development of drought impacts. The complex and insidious nature of drought means that all these indicators are proxies to understand the impacts that dry conditions are having on an area. Our main suggestion here would be to examine the World Meteorological Organisation Handbook of Drought Indicators and Indices (which are classified in a traffic-light method of ease of use) identifies which indices could be available and appropriate for the context.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 15](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=15&annotation=XR5BI5Y7))


% possibly shorten this.. naming all these indices might be a little overkill, though naming none is also not feasible.
Precipitation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture, lake and groundwater levels, streamflow and vegetation water stress are among the most prominent drought indicators \autocite{europeandroughtobservatoryDroughtIndicators2017}. In order to adequately account for the different drought stages different drought indices, that aggregate these and other indicators, are applied. Among the most prominent meteorological drought indics are the Standardized Precipitation Index \textit{SPI} together with its extension the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index \textit{SPEI} \autocite{europeandroughtobservatoryDroughtIndicators2017,ncarStandardizedPrecipitationEvapotranspiration,ncarStandardizedPrecipitationIndex}. Agricultural drought indices like the Soil Moisture Anomaly \textit{SMA} or the Anomaly of Vegetation Condition \textit{FAPAR Anomaly} are based on soil moisture indicators and absorbed radiation fractions, respectively. By quantifying water flow volumina, the Low Flow Index \textit{LFI} belongs to the hydrological drought indices \autocite{europeandroughtobservatoryDroughtIndicators2017, svobodaHandbookDroughtIndicators2016}. In addition to these and other types of indices, such as Combined Drought Indices, the \textit{Handbook for Drought Indicators and Indices} lists over 50 drought indicators and indices. For further and more in-depth information, please refer to the interactive website of the \arcfull{IDMP} launched by the \acrfull{wmo} and \acrfull*{gwp} \autocite{idmpIndicatorsIndicesIntegrated2021}. 

All of these drought indices give a good impression about the physical side of climate anomalies, but none of the above mentioned indices link those climate anomalies to socioeconomic vulnerabilities \autocite{enenkelWhyPredictClimate2020}. \autocite{mishraWaterSecurityChanging2021} argue, that the framing of water security challenges extends beyond singular indicators. \autocite{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022} argue further, that assessments that only consider physical factors overlook the broader impact of drought on social, economic, and ecological systems.
The simple but widely used Falkenmark Indicator (Falkenmark et al. 1989) incorporates human factors by calculating a ratio between the given amount of water and the number of people living within that domain. By further categorizing this ratio to a level of water scarcity, the Falkenmark Indicator indicates the supply sides effects of water scarcity but variabilities, demand and socioeconomic factors are not represented. More dedicated indices like the \acrfull*{iwmi} Indicator and the \acrfull*{wpi} as well as other indices measuring water security give a more extensive representation of the overall situation \autocite{arreguin-cortesMunicipalLevelWater2019,liuWaterScarcityAssessments2017}. The \arcshort{wpi} for example represents the weighted average of five pre-standardized components namely, water availability, access, capacity, use and environment \autocite{sullivanWaterPovertyIndex2003}.

Determining the right set of indicators and indices for a given region to e.g. assess hazard severity depends on the objective and available data and is often a balancing act between many factors and circumstances \autocite{svobodaHandbookDroughtIndicators2016}. Besides the pure description of what certain natural or social circumstances \textit{are}, there is an growing interest to understand what these conditions will \textit{do} \autocite{boultDroughtImpactbasedForecasting2022, lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}.

The effects of these conditions on the ground are most often called the \textit{impact} of a certain weather phenomenon or climate development such as a drought hazard. Impacts can be direct or indirect and a generally difficult to quantify economically \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. The level of impact is commonly determined based on the severity of the hazard, the exposure of the investigated elements and their respective vulnerabilities \autocite{harrowsmithFutureForecastImpact2020,svobodaHandbookDroughtIndicators2016,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.
This concept is generally expressed by the risk equation

        \[Risk = f(Hazard, Exposure, Vulnerability)\]

    where

        \[Vulnerability = f(Level of Coping Capacity, Level of Adaptive Capacity)\]

\autocite{boultDroughtImpactbasedForecasting2022,harrowsmithFutureForecastImpact2020,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. Drought hazard can be evaluated and described by the above mentioned indicators and indices with difficulties lying in the contextualization and setting of the threshold levels to separate between fluctuations within the normal range and extreme events. Exposure is commonly defined as social, economic, cultural or natural assets, services or resources in places that could be adversely affected by a hazard \autocite{ipccClimateChange20142014}. Exposed elements can be more ore less vulnerable to the hazard. Vulnerability conditions are determined by the sensitivity or susceptibility of a system, community or individual to physical, social, economic or environmental factors or processes \autocite{ipccClimateChange20142014}. These conditions are often further described as the level of coping and adaptive capacities. Coping capacities refer to available skills and resources of systems, organizations or individuals to address, manage and overcome unfavourable circumstances \autocite{ipccGlossaryTerms2012}. In the same manner, adaptive capacities relate to preparation, reduction and moderation of those impacts.

The establishement of a functional relationship between the hazard, exposure and vulnerability to its impact can be rather difficult for numerous reasons and is further discussed by \autocite{boultDroughtImpactbasedForecasting2022} for interested readers. Moreover, all these factors change over time, so that the quality of the calculations depends strongly on the timeliness of the data basis \autocite{harrowsmithFutureForecastImpact2020}. 

Relatively recent approaches argue for numerous benefits and reasons for greater inclusion of local knowledge and community integration in these approaches \autocite{balehegnIndigenousWeatherClimate2019,dubeFrameworkIntegrationTraditional2016,ebhuomaFrameworkIntegratingScientific2020,giordanoIntegrationLocalScientific2013a,greyIntegratingLocalIndigenous2020,hermansExploringIntegrationLocal2022a,mercerCultureDisasterRisk2012,mutasaKnowledgeApartheidDisaster2015,nyetanyaneIntegrationIndigenousKnowledge2020,nyongValueIndigenousKnowledge2007}. Another emerging area in scientific interest is the gender inequality of drought impacts \autocite{acharyaWhenRiverTalks2019,fanningDroughtDisplacementLivelihoods2018,hiwasakiLocalIndigenousKnowledge2015,mustafaGenderingFloodEarly2015,sachsRoutledgeHandbookGender2020,saniGenderOtherVulnerabilities2022}. Although these topics are of great interest, they fall largely outside the scope of this particular work.

An understanding of the severity of droughts and their current impacts enables targeted responses, as well as to allow for the development of future predictions based on current conditions. In this context, recent efforts have increasingly emphasized proactive and forward-looking measures in disaster relief initiatives. The forthcoming chapter will explore this relatively recent shift in approach and its implications for improving drought management strategies.


\section{FbF, EAP, AA & Early Warning + trigger}
% one possible solution to prevent impact
% FbF
% IFRC & RCRC
% EAPs
% Early Warning/Actions &  Anticipatory Actions
% triggered by forecast

Traditionally, disaster management efforts have primarily focused on long-term preparedness or post-disaster response, thus only providing assistance and relief to affected communities after a disaster has occurred (TODO: policy overview, hyogo framework [UNISDR], coughland et al 2015). The lack of standardized procedures for forecast-based actions led to disaster warnings often going unheard \autocite{kolenImpactsStormXynthia2013}. In the context of increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, coupled with the impacts of climate change, the need for a more proactive approach that can reduce the impact of disasters on vulnerable communities became apparent \autocite{coughlandeperezForecastbasedFinancingApproach2015,trisosAfrica2022}. Nonetheless, financial resources were for the time being strongly directed towards post-disaster response and incentives to invest in new and complex scientific developments including relatively high uncertainties were limited \autocite{coughlandeperezActionbasedFloodForecasting2016}. This changed with the development and successful integration of several new forecast-based financing systems that utilized the opportunity gap between a forecast and the disaster to successfully reduce corresponding impact. Based on this, to "substantially increase the availability of and access to multi-hazard early warning systems and disaster risk information and assessments to people by 2030" became one of seven global targets of the Sendai for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 framework \autocites{coughlandeperezActionbasedFloodForecasting2016}[12]{undrrSendaiFrameworkDisaster}. Today, large institutions have now specialized sections for the financing of Early Actions such as the Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems Initiative \textit{(CREWS)} and the Global Risk Financing Facility \textit{(GRiF)} to support and backup \acfp{ea} \autocite{crewsClimateRiskEarly,GlobalRiskFinancing}. Forecast-based Financing \textit{(FbF)} has thus emerged as a promising approach to disaster management that enables proactive, timely, and cost-effective responses to disasters \autocite{coughlandeperezForecastbasedFinancingApproach2015} (TODO: add “FORECAST-BASED FINANCING An innovative approach” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3C2CE7BS?page=1&annotation=UKWEKCTA))).

The IFRC together with the Red Cross Climate Center \textit{(RCCC)} and German Red Cross \textit{(GRC)} have developed and improved the FbF programme to fund EAs since 2007 \autocite{ifrcForecastbasedFinancingNew2019}. 

\missingfigure[options]{“Figure 1 - FbF Diagram” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=3&annotation=W3UC7H26))}

Following \autocite{coughlandeperezForecastbasedFinancingApproach2015, coughlandeperezActionbasedFloodForecasting2016} the structure of FbF can be distilled down to:
    “When forecast states that an agreed-upon probability threshold is exceeded for a hazard of a designated magnitude, then an action with an associated cost must be taken that has a desired effect and is carried out by a designated organisation.” \autocite[2]{coughlandeperezActionbasedFloodForecasting2016}.
Thus, the FbF approach involves three key components (1) triggering (2) pre-defined EAs and securing a (3) financing mechanism in advance (compare \ref{TODO: figure fbf}) (TODO: “Forecast-based Financing A new era for the humanitarian system” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/KQZXSWVN?page=1&annotation=3BW2ZYST))). These components are summarized in an Early Action Protocol \textit{(EAP)} (TODO: cite policy overview “These three components are summarized in Early Action Protocols (EAPs).” ([“Forecast-based financing: A policy overview”, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/35XBEGJ7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8YZAQB5L?page=2&annotation=58UQZK6T))).

%-----------------------------------

\subsection{EAP and drought specifics}

In the \acrfull*{eap} triggers, actions to be taken and financing mechanisms are clearly outlined, thus summerizing and explicitly assigning responsibilities to the involved actors, ensuring that everyone understands their role and task in the event of activation \autocite{ruthForecastbasedFinancingPolicy2017}. This results in clear accountability and full commitment from all stakeholders, facilitating the timely and efficient implementation of the predetermined actions \autocite{ruthForecastbasedFinancingPolicy2017}.

Two types of analyses, namely the identification of forecasts and the risk assessment, form the basis for specifying the trigger, affected regions, and selected actions in the \acshort*{eap} (see Figure \ref*{TODO:}). 


\missingfigure{“Figure 2 - EAP Validation Steps” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=4&annotation=6WWVYXLT))}


Both assessments are primarily based on historic data and experiences. To identify suitable forecast(s), various forecasts are compared and analyzed in terms of their capacities and performance to predict hazards. This is done mainly through a historically grounded analysis. Ultimately, a specific impact treshold based on one or a combination of several impact-based forecasts becomes the basis for triggering actions. This trigger also depends on the outcome of the risk assessment, as the impact of the hazard is highly influenced by the risk on site \autocite{ifrcFbFPractitionersManual2023,ifrcForecastbasedFinancingNew2019}.

The risk assessment is a complex analysis that takes numerous factors on scales of the hazard, and its sub-hazards, exposure, vulnerability and together with its coping and adaptive capacities, into account \autocite{ifrcFbFPractitionersManual2023}. Potential inputs depend strongly on the respective hazard and can range from records of historical events, housing location and building structures in the case of hurricanes and floods to social factors like income, demographics and school attendance. The objective being the identification of corresponding impact levels, thus determining the most effective actions and allocating resources as objectively as possible. Nonetheless, most of these parameters are proxies, as direct information about locallized impact is seldom, outdated, of low accuracy or quality \autocite{ifrcFbFPractitionersManual2023}.

Due to the majority of the implemented \acrshortpl{eap} concentrating on fast onset disasters such as floods, hurricanes or strong rains, the FbF concept were primarily focussed and developed in this regard. Here, typically a sole trigger and its associated set of actions are established, emphasizing rapid responses, given that there is often less than 48 hours between the activation and the occurrence of the disaster. \autocite{rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020}. Drought as a usually slow-onset hazard, on the other hand, pose unique structural challenges to the process of determining thresholds to trigger actions as impact builds up over time and is highly dependent on the context \autocite{boultDroughtImpactbasedForecasting2022}. These challenges of identifying a forecast, determining a trigger and seclting actions are further outlined in the coming chapters.

%TODO: chechen ob das auch wirklich so ist..
The specification of the financing mechanism as one of the three key components will not be covered in any further detail in this work, as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies \textit{(IFRC)} has extended their Disaster Relief Emergency Fund \textit{(DREF)} with Forecast-based Action as dedicated mechanism to adequately support their increased numbers of FbF projects. Once the forecast-based trigger is met and the EAP is activated, the financing mechanism automatically assigns resources, which solves the issue of financing to a large extent and is therefore no longer of great interest to this piece of work.

threshold/trigger definition --> balancing between "comparing the risk of acting in vain, versus the risk of failing to act" https://manual.forecast-based-financing.org/en/chapter/glossary/
--> mention The risk of \textit{acting in vain} 

“Early warning Early Action (EWEA) mitigates the risk of vulnerable people adopting extreme negative coping strategies or becoming dependent on aid. Additionally, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that early action is far more cost-effective than late humanitarian response. Two recent studies on early response and disaster resilience in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia showed that even if there is uncertainty that a high-magnitude drought will occur, the cost difference is so significant that investing in early action measures is still more cost-effective.1,2” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=3&annotation=BGQSB3HK))


“Ultimately, the value of forecast-based financing systems will be greater than simply the losses avoided when the fund is released. If such a system is in place, actors in that region will be aware that many disaster effects are likely to be prevented due to forecast-based action.” ([Mariani et al., 2015, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/8THVVJVK)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GYUFNK32?page=9&annotation=KTZT5VDQ))

“Given the different layers of complexity with drought, different types of triggers may be required beyond what is often used in EAP development. For instance, unconventional triggers for FbA for drought could include metrics such as staple food prices, percentages of crop failure, and other elements of food security early warning systems.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 30](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=30&annotation=JZV26DPP))

“As explained in the previous section, droughts do not have clear start and end dates, but the timing of below average rainfall matters deeply. Particularly for crops and forage, a dry spell at the beginning of the planting season can be particularly devastating for crop yields. As such, in order to act in anticipation, triggering systems must be based on monitoring and forecasting at the right times to capture these events and act early.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 29](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=29&annotation=KIUB7HJP))

“Notably, situations and forecasts can change throughout the seasons.

“Many practitioners and experts interviewed for this work suggested that a staggered triggering system, at different lead times and for different early actions may be the most appropriate to tackle drought” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 31](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=31&annotation=X34YUJMF))

"Trigger(s) statement

The  Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) food security projections (ML2) produced by FEWSNET will be used as trigger information. 
The trigger will be assessed between June and August before the Deyr (October-December) season , between August and December before the Gu (April-June) season, always with the  publication of the food security outlooks.


Trigger source is IPC food security projections produced by FEWSNET https://fews.net/. 
Projections for October-January (available between June and August) and  February-May (available from August to December) will be used as a trigger 
The trigger threshold is a projected IPC phase in the relevant period to meet or exceed 4 (emergency). 
The FEWS NET IPC includes rainfall scenarios based on the Climate and Hazards Centre (CHC) forecast, but also integrates a range of current-status information on food security. It is expected that this provides the “best guess” for projections of food security, and more relevant for the prioritised impact (food shortage) than rainfall totals alone. The skill of the IPC forecast in east africa was assessed in general in Backer & Billing (2021). The forecast has an overall accuracy of 83,64 %. 
The trigger was set at phase 4 (“Emergency”), which is linked to very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality, or emergency livelihood strategies and asset liquidation. 
Using a phase 4 threshold since 2019 would have led to 5 triggers in Burco and 3 triggers respectively in Erigavo and Xudun, considering all forecasts available in 2 month steps. In Burco the trigger would have been reached throughout all forecasts for 2022 affecting 584.000 people. In Erigavo the trigger would have been reached in 2019 (affecting 269.000 people) and two times in 2022 (affecting first 144.000 and later on 269.000 people). The district Xudun would have been triggered in 2019 and two times 2022, affecting 41.000 people respectively.
By comparison, triggering on projection of phase 3 or higher would have led to 15 triggers in each of the pilot districts. A phase 5 threshold would have led to no triggers so far in Somaliland (FEWSNET data)."

Drought indices vs. drought forecast
Drought indices and drought forecasts are two different types of tools used to assess and manage drought conditions. The main differences between the two are as follows:
Definition and purpose: Drought indices are statistical measures that describe the severity and duration of drought conditions based on historical and current weather data. They provide a snapshot of current conditions and serve as an indicator of the overall drought situation. Drought forecasts, on the other hand, use climate models and weather data to predict future drought conditions and provide early warning of potential drought events.
Timeframe: Drought indices provide a retrospective analysis of current drought conditions, while drought forecasts look ahead to potential drought conditions. Drought indices are typically calculated over a period of weeks or months, while drought forecasts can extend months or even years into the future.
Data requirements: Drought indices rely on historical and current weather data to calculate indicators of drought severity, such as soil moisture, streamflow, and precipitation. Drought forecasts, on the other hand, use complex climate models and a range of environmental data sources to generate probabilistic predictions of future drought conditions.
Usefulness: Drought indices are useful for tracking the progression of drought over time and can provide information to policymakers and resource managers to make decisions about water allocation and conservation measures. Drought forecasts are useful for predicting the likelihood and severity of future drought events, which can help policymakers and resource managers to plan for drought response and mitigation measures.
In summary, drought indices are retrospective measures of current drought conditions, while drought forecasts are predictive tools that look ahead to potential future drought events. Both tools are important for managing drought conditions and informing drought response and mitigation measures. (ChatGPT)

The main challenges for drought impact-based forecasting (IbF) as described in this text include:

Difficulty in directly forecasting drought impacts: It can be challenging to establish a functional relationship between drought hazards and impacts, as past humanitarian aid and development may have weakened this link, and sufficient impact data may be unavailable. In addition, the relationship between hazard severity and impact is mediated by vulnerability, which is not always fully understood.

Issues with predefined systems: Predefined IbF systems that rely on predefined trigger thresholds and pre-agreed actions may not be able to adapt to changing vulnerabilities over time. These systems also rely on expert judgement during system development, which may be subject to bias and may not accurately reflect the complexity of the system.


“Moreover, if the complex relationships linking multihazards to multi-impacts obscure attribution of particular impacts to particular hazards, hazard-focused organisations may be limited by their institutional mandate and thus unable to act.” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=4&annotation=2XG6YP8D))

interesting!!! Fig. 1. A hybrid framework for multi-hazard IbF. Refer to the main text for a definition of numbers. Black arrows and numbers: components common across predefined humanitarian IbF systems. Blue arrows and numbers: real-time components. Grids represent spatially varying values. Darker reds indicate higher values of risk, vulnerability, and thresholds. In this example, despite only low to moderate risk in the southwest square, increased dynamic vulnerability lowers the threshold for action, resulting in triggering. Meanwhile, reduced vulnerability in the northern squares elevates trigger thresholds, so the northeast square no longer triggers. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

A hydrometeorological forecast indicating the likelihood of drought occurring is combined with a predefined assessment of static vulnerability to determine risk. Where static vulnerability is higher (Fig. 1: northern squares), trigger thresholds are lower. 2) Risk is compared to agreed-upon thresholds for action. 3) If risk is greater than or equal to the threshold, early action is triggered to mitigate the worst impacts of drought.

% impacts may vary depending on variuous factors such as ...
“(a) meteorological droughts evolve collectively into a prolonged hydrological drought (pooling);” ([Wang et al., 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/AWKLZ543)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/4YRNMM9P?page=2&annotation=NAJPZFFV))


Proposed Framework:
--> 1)“A hydrometeorological forecast indicating the likelihood of drought occurring is combined with a predefined assessment of static vulnerability to determine risk. Where static vulnerability is higher (Fig. 1: northern squares), trigger thresholds are lower.
2) Risk is compared to agreed-upon thresholds for action.
3) If risk is greater than or equal to the threshold, early action is triggered to mitigate the worst impacts of drought.” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=5&annotation=KDCBHGC6))



“We then propose a number of components to account for dynamic vulnerabilities caused by concurrent hazards:
4)Expert judgement is utilised to determine dynamic vulnerabilities. For instance, conflict, pest outbreaks, or recent hydrometeorological events, may act to increase vulnerability to drought in the affected location.
5) In locations where vulnerability is elevated (Fig. 1: southwest square), the predefined forecast threshold (“danger level”) is relaxed in order to trigger for less severe droughts. This acknowledges that those with elevated vulnerabilities require support even if drought is only slight. In regions where dynamic vulnerability is lower (Fig. 1: northern squares), the predefined forecast threshold may be raised, to avoid the perception of false alarms if a less severedrought does not have significant impact on food security (the trigger threshold for northern squares is elevated to reflect reduced vulnerability). Balancing of lower thresholds for vulnerable regions against higher thresholds for less vulnerable regions reduces the need for ‘safety nets’, enabling more accurate anticipation of donor costs.
6) If risk exceeds the adjusted thresholds, early actions are triggered. Early actions may need to be adapted to account for multihazards.” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=5&annotation=XV9GPPQF))

“In humanitarian practice, the term "drought" is often used to refer to some socio-meteorological combination where water shortages produce stress on human and livelihood systems. Droughts are a function of the fragility of human systems, and they become disasters where systems cannot cope with deviations from the hydro-meteorological norm. It has been argued that droughts are particularly devastating when livelihood choices are strongly determined by the climate (e.g. the decision to grow certain crops, or traditional seasonal migration patterns) - for instance, if in a given year, the weather patterns are different than normal, those livelihoods are especially vulnerable to these changes. It has also been argued that droughts pose specific challenges to income generating activities marked by low productivity that are not able to take advantage of ‘good years’ in order to provide a buffer during ‘bad years’.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 12](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=12&annotation=C622YWIR))

“Therefore, the impacts of drought could be mitigated by managing water demand through crop management, modifying water allocation rules during times of water scarcity, developing various water resources (such as groundwater recharge and salt water desalination), managing multiple water use, setting up water-trading mechanisms in advance of times of drought or scarcity, and physically redistributing available supplies during times of scarcity [26].” ([Wang et al., 2016, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/AWKLZ543)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/4YRNMM9P?page=2&annotation=S8QKSIPL))

"Suggested AA
The feasibility study identifies a number of high potential early actions in response to anticipated drought, including:

Water storage rehabilitation – berked repairs and re-charging can be undertaken at a reasonable cost with available skills within the lead time afforded by a drought forecast;
De-stocking – this is an effective mitigation against asset loss in the time preceding a forecast drought;
Early planting or alternative short growth crops – the MoA has experience in advising farmers on alternative short growth crops to facilitate harvesting before drought onset (Ministry can advise farmers to plant maize rather than sorghum as it has a 50% shorter growing season)
Cash distribution programs – SRCS’ long experience in cash programs make this a ready approach to mitigating suffering in coordination with the CWG;
Women/child shelters – SRCS Protection program can work with government to ensure acceleration of staffing and resources for support in the period ahead of drought onset.
→ Need to work with this Ministry in a drought-focused FbF – on both the forecasting and early response sides. On the latter, for example, in the event of a forecast drought the Ministry can advise farmers to plant maize rather than sorghum as it has a 50% shorter growing season.

→ According to the Somaliland Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development (Director of Planning) there are limited options for early action prior to a forecast drought as livestock owners are reluctant to de-stock, do not trust scientific forecasting, and there is no internationally approved abattoir so there is a limit to the absorptive capacity of the local market for massive de-stocking. Options such as improving water supply, pasture sequestration and promoting fodder production are more effective if resources are available.

→ While conflict is difficult to forecast accurately, its frequent upsurge in times of drought needs to be seen as a potential impact of drought. Drought early action planning, therefore, should consider actions to mitigate the impact of conflict. This notion applies to other ancillary impacts, such as migration, noted above, or food insecurity"

% otherwise: 7.3 subsection water source mapping but I think it might be a good start here to introduce on site information
"In all, mapping presents many benefits, such as:

It makes easier to integrate data from different sources (surveys, censuses, satellites, etc.) and from different disciplines (social, economic, and environmental data). It also allows the switch to new units of analysis from, for example, administrative boundaries (e.g. state) to ecological boundaries (e.g. basin).
Maps are a powerful visual tool and are more easily understood by stakeholders, particularly in developing countries.
The spatial nature of water poverty, such as the distance to the nearest water source or the water supply infrastructure, can also be incorporated easily in a GIS database.
The allocation of resources can be improved, since geographic targeting is more efficient and cost-effective than to launch an equally expensive universal distribution programme.
Geo-referenced databases can be enriched by additional data as they become available; and new attributes, such as better details on water quality, can be incorporated into the data structure, ensuring that the relevance of the data is sustained over time.
Maps can be produced at a number of different resolutions depending on their purpose and the cost of data collection. A coarse resolution or a scale too small neglects the heterogeneity within each unit and provides insufficient detail for decision making, while a fine resolution or a scale too large increases the cost of compiling, managing, and analyzing the data."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_point_mapping

% possibly a good start for the transition from impact indicators to Crowdsensing because this is slow and relatively coarse.

“select a small group of communities (two to three) that they deemed representative of the larger population (10–12 locations) in their operation area. Within this group, FPs are then required to contact two to four community actors and integrate the shock information into a single data submission per area.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 8](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=8&annotation=YLEYNUY3))

“In line with the above objectives, BRCiS designed the RTRM system to provide timely, community-generated shock information on key trends to trigger early actions in BRCiS operational areas.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=5&annotation=LDCLNI5G))

% also in the chapter about the trigger -> makes for a good comparison to Richards levels and threshold indicators
“Primary water source condition Observation of the status of the largest rainwater catchment in the area (at the end of rainy seasons) More than half-full (75%) or full Half-full (50%) at the end of rainy season Less than half-full (25%)/empty” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=6&annotation=HMGNP355))

“Half of all respondents stated that digital shock questionnaires would be too complex to handle if they were filled exclusively by community leaders, and translation to Somali language was recommended.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=9&annotation=BM8PXNQ5))

“Around half of survey respondents emphasised that community leaders taking part in RTRM are well aware that reported shock data may influence the probability of receiving future humanitarian assistance in their area.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=9&annotation=8KNB2WAI))

“For every red-flagged area, the respective early warning FPs contextualise the situation, interpret the indicators, triangulate with secondary data sources and propose relevant early action measures. This triangulation stage compares community and arealevel data with data at a higher geographical level (e.g., livelihood zone or district), contextualising the situation with the broader situation in other regions of Somalia.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 9](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=9&annotation=ST2P2WYY))

“This process includes the analysis of satellite-derived climate data and information from sources. Further third-party secondary data such as the FSNAU EWEA dashboard, WHO-Early Warning, Alert and Response Network data or other NGO assessments – also contribute to the triangulation process. District-level and macro-level data provide an evidence base to triangulate subjective information from communities, local authorities or field staff.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=10&annotation=69DDN2D8))

“Therefore, for slow-onset shocks captured by the BRCiS RTRM, early action decision-triggering is possible within 12 days after the data collection.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=10&annotation=HFQHTQKN))

“In practice, however, delays in RTRM data collection in the field and in the submission of EWEA forms have been frequent due to operational challenges and other factors. The average timeline between the submission of RTRM data and the submission of early action recommendations in the EWEA forms was 25 days.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=10&annotation=CL7QZEA6))

“The consortium aims to reduce this time-lapse to a maximum of 12 days. For sudden shocks such as riverine or flash floods, the time for programme managers to trigger early response was limited to one to four days following the rapid assessment of impacts within communities.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=10&annotation=HNG6XTD8))

acceptance of the "crowd" is difficult to measure/identify/survey as no direct communication is possible. --> Good literature work e.g. “The basis of TAM consists of four main elements: the perceived usefulness of the application, the perceived ease of use when using the application, behavioural intention to use the application and the actual use.” ([Minkman, 2015, p. 12](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/ZKLE6CPT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/QMAPCSZG?page=12&annotation=IM5DGRJP))

“Since today's citizen science studies are mostly located in high-income countries, we are enthusiastic to motivate the scientific community to conduct citizen science studies in low-income countries.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1598](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=9&annotation=TYD7Q2ZD))

“According to the Hyogo Framework for Action, increasing resilience to drought requires the development of a people-centered monitoring and early warning system, or in other words, a system capable of providing useful and understandable information to the community at risk.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 523](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=1&annotation=ELTIKEZV))

“After 1 y, we detect modest reductions in groundwater pumping and modest improvements in water quality and user satisfaction. Although replications are needed, the results imply that externally encouraged, community-based monitoring can improve the management of shared resources.” ([Bernedo Del Carpio et al., 2021, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/4ZDB6DYE)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/D7G4LR6W?page=1&annotation=HQ4A6SZV))

“This is because citizen  science is most successful when:   
• the aim/questions are clear;  
• engagement with people is given a high priority;  
• sufficient resources are available to begin and continue the project until its completion;  
• scale of sampling is relatively large (because it is often not cost‐efficient to use a citizen  science approach at small spatio‐temporal scales);  
• the protocol required for data collection is not too complex.”

1. Low cost data collection method
2. Flexible monitoring scheme
3. Involves Citizens


“Citizen Science is a broad term encompassing many different types of environmental monitoring and observation projects that are conducted by non-governmental organizations and individuals, often in partnership with research institutions and government agencies (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, 2015). Community-based water monitoring (CBWM) is a specific faction of citizen science that has become increasingly sophisticated and widespread, notably in Canada, the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Southeast Asia (Koehler & Koontz, 2008).” ([Weston and Conrad, 2015, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/49HXDHSH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/CCHM5SNH?page=1&annotation=F2WVK6BV))

% is volunteer monitoring any good?
“Results from the statewide TST dataset include 82 separate station/year ANOVAs and demonstrate that large-scale, existing volunteer and professional data with unpaired samples can show agreement of~80\% for all analyzed parameters (DO =77\%, pH =79\%, conductivity = 85\%). Inaddition, toassess whether limiting variation within the source datasets increased the level ofagreement between volunteers and professionals, data were analyzed atalocal scale. Data from asingle partner city, with increased controls on sampling times and locations and correction ofasystematic bias inDO, confirmed this by showing an even greater agreement of91\% overall from 2009–2017 (DO =91\%, pH =83\%, conductivity =100\%).” ([Albus et al., 2020, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/DMCGSGUU)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/PRI5ALTR?page=1\&annotation=63J3WN2P))

“The results suggest that citizen science can be a cost-effective method to collect essential monitoring information and can also produce the high levels of citizen engagement that are vital to the adaptive management learning process.” ([Aceves-Bueno et al., 2015, p. 493](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/YK2MKLA9)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/WGGHNGZB?page=1&annotation=ZQQBEP74))

\subsubsection{Volunteersensing}
what about the volunteers? how many? where are they? How to they spread over the country?
“Meadow et al. (2013) recommended using trained agency staff to report drought status on a regular basis” ([Lackstrom et al., 2022, p. 27](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/YI366LQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3JTQ72UN?page=27\&annotation=AUZV7SZN))

provide hypothesis - 'integration' of local stakeholders/volunteers into drought and water source monitoring can help to get a better picture for early drought impact assessment and thus better and faster management and reactions
+ local people are engaged with the process and come into contact with 'scientific' knowledge/forecasts 
+ equal inclusion of local / indigenous knowledge and scientific forecasts can enhance the quality and make it more relevant on smaller scales (meso/mikro/local level)

benefits of monitoring by external support:
“Therefore, the model of community management combined with external support has far-reaching benefits to rural water supply.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 144](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=9&annotation=HU2CNZC2))

“For local communities, their needs of safe drinking water could be met and their abilities to manage and maintain water supply could be enhanced.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 144](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=9&annotation=AL2NB5DK))

“For external experts, they may also benefit from community support to inform scientific processes, such as collecting data that spans across a large geographic region and having an enhanced understanding of community interests.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 144](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=9&annotation=QPIKDKB9))

“Furthermore, this model could help increase scientific awareness among community members and engage the community with the environment.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 144](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=9&annotation=FYU4BIKP))

“During the management of rural drinking water sources, a hybrid modality in which community management is the mainstay with supplement from external support from other organizations is highly recommended.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=SQ6P8UBN))

“Community cultures, economies, and environments differ across countries and regions. These differences should be considered when designing hybrid management strategies, so that all actors can be appropriately enabled and the mechanism which is most effective for the given community can be identified.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=WV5DXV5I))

“On this basis, it is essential to expand research area to study the various threats from climate variability to rural drinking water safety, and then to develop corresponding measures to address those threats to water security.” ([Huang et al., 2020, p. 147](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/9CSBLJNJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/G5BEZQ7C?page=12&annotation=HCQHR7YR))

\subsubsection{Motivation of Volunteers}

“we conclude that the active participation is not depending on the actual education level but rather induced by their personal perception of and dependency on their environment. Especially citizens who depend on local water resources are expected to be interested in increasing their understanding of their environment and to participate in local political decisions to ensure a sustainable use of their resources (Overdevest et al., 2004).” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1596](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=7&annotation=58MAGPAQ))

“At the same time, low participation rates at some stations can be attributed partly to the transmitting cost of 0.01 USD per text message, which was paid by the volunteers. Especially in rural areas, participants expressed that they might be unable to participate due to costs.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1596](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=7&annotation=86AIS5QQ))

“Buytaert et al. (2014) described that observers in low-income countries often derive an income from their engagement in citizen-science projects. These authors argue, that the concept of sending data voluntarily is not well developed, and that it may be necessary to reward people at local wages for motivation.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1596](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=7&annotation=JUZWKKNE))

“We found that paying a small reward that covers the costs significantly increases the overall participation rate.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1596](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=7&annotation=PTWU32DL))
--> seven times larger with reimbursement system in place


or: collective coverage of the costs

“Instead of a reimbursement centrally paid by the project, interested water users organised an own reward system by collecting a contribution from several users to reimburse one person recording the water level data. However, a real payment or reward was not necessary, since the intrinsic motivation of the participants seemed to be sufficient when lack of money was overcome.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1597](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=8&annotation=S4IKR9K9))

mostly concerned about water quality

“Data inaccuracy, access limitations, a lack of thresholds and inadequate resources for data collection resulted in non-standardised information, preventing comparison across areas and weakening strategic decision-making” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=4&annotation=L5SELDEJ))

“Even when receiving timely information on the ground, Members often had to wait for validation from national sources such as the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) to make decisions, and the resources for anticipatory action were very limited.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=4&annotation=CZST8S2L))

\subsection{water source mapping}
"In all, mapping presents many benefits, such as:

It makes easier to integrate data from different sources (surveys, censuses, satellites, etc.) and from different disciplines (social, economic, and environmental data). It also allows the switch to new units of analysis from, for example, administrative boundaries (e.g. state) to ecological boundaries (e.g. basin).
Maps are a powerful visual tool and are more easily understood by stakeholders, particularly in developing countries.
The spatial nature of water poverty, such as the distance to the nearest water source or the water supply infrastructure, can also be incorporated easily in a GIS database.
The allocation of resources can be improved, since geographic targeting is more efficient and cost-effective than to launch an equally expensive universal distribution programme.
Geo-referenced databases can be enriched by additional data as they become available; and new attributes, such as better details on water quality, can be incorporated into the data structure, ensuring that the relevance of the data is sustained over time.
Maps can be produced at a number of different resolutions depending on their purpose and the cost of data collection. A coarse resolution or a scale too small neglects the heterogeneity within each unit and provides insufficient detail for decision making, while a fine resolution or a scale too large increases the cost of compiling, managing, and analyzing the data."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_point_mapping

\subsection{Hazards and risks}

“Spotlight on Somalia: Can we learn from failure? In Somalia in 2011, a famine was declared that, along with the complexity of the conflict situation, was responsible for thousands of deaths. At its peak, almost 4 in every 10 children in Southern Somalia were acutely malnourished, and 4 million people were estimated to be without basic food. The horror of this tragedy has since haunted the international community, who received 11 months of early warnings before a famine was declared. Beginning with La Nina forecasts almost one year in advance, FEWS-NET and others provided briefing notes and warning information to humanitarian actors in the region. Several months later, these alerts explained that rainy seasons had already failed, and that major impacts were extremely likely (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012). There has been a great deal of analysis of this event, in which several conclusions have come to light. One is that funding needs to be more readily available based on forecasted information (Lautze et al. 2012). The below graph (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012) demonstrates how large-scale funding was mobilized in the aftermath of the famine declaration, and was ultimately available after the most vulnerable had died. Secondly, the humanitarian community needs to clearly take responsibility for acting in advance of a disaster, even in complex cases like the Somali context. At the moment, such organizations are not held accountable for failure to act on early warning, as disaster response is considered business-asusual. Shouldering the responsibility to act in this critical moment between a warning and a disaster could avoid such impacts in the future (Lautze et al. 2012).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/WKFPUZCW?page=7&annotation=LIY2ABLI))

“The number of affected people will be 1,200,420 persons across all the six main regions in Somaliland.

%% Risk analysis

"Prioritised hazard and its historical impact.
Drought is currently the most relevant hazard in Somaliland . Droughts have occurred frequently for the last decades and presented varied impacts (The Somaliland drought rapid assessment report commissioned by the National Drought Committee in January 2022).  The occurrence of droughts has increased over the last years from one in five years to one drought every two years. The majority of the population depends on (agro) pastoral agriculture. Since this type of livelihood depends fundamentally on the natural resources of pasture and water, the local population is highly vulnerable to droughts. 
According to the International Database for Disasters ( EM DAT) recent droughts in Somaliland occurred in 2004, 2010 to 2011, 2014 to 2017, 2019, and 2021 to 2023. The drought incidents have mainly caused food shortages due to below-average crop production, livestock loss and water shortages. The impacts are also in line with the historical drought impacts of the communities in the Eastern regions of Somaliland, i.e. Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer where communities were consulted in focus group discussions as part of the ongoing FbF project.  Since 2018 there has been a drought in 2019 and the current drought (2020-2023). This is also in line with the historical Combined Drought Index (CDI) data (FAO SWALIM). The CDI is a proven and reliable indicator of drought since it incorporates precipitation, soil moisture and vegetation health. While the country has experienced periodic severe drought conditions over the CDI assessment period from 2002 to 2022, the eastern regions have experienced the most extreme drought conditions, especially in the last two years. Droughts in Somaliland lead to a variety of negative impacts. Chief among them is increased food insecurity. EM DAT  lists food shortage and famine as the principal impact of all droughts since 1987. Furthermore, based on the Food Insecurity Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) data, every drought is associated with substantial spikes in food-insecure populations. For example, the current drought led up to December 2022 to 5.6 million people in or above IPC 3 (crisis). Since 2009, Somaliland has experienced a IPC average between class 2 and 3 (between stressed and crisis), whereby the very western regions Awdal and the eastern regions (Sanaag, Sool and Togdheer) have been most affected reaching IPC classification 3 or worse in almost a quarter of assessment periods (every 2 months). 
The exact processes which lead to food insecurity due to drought are diverse. In the case of pastoral communities, failed rainy seasons result in livestock and herders having to track longer distances to water sources. These circumstances and lower forage and water availability lead to poor livestock health, increasing livestock deaths and lower birth rates, which can amount to the loss of whole herds. Milk production decreases drastically, which is the reason for the lower diet variability of herders. Furthermore, herders have to sell their animals for lower prices due to their lower body conditions and increased supply. This was the case during the 2017 drought. In some cases, whole herds were lost. The price of milk products increased significantly. At the peak of the drought in 2017, 388.000 children suffered from malnutrition and 895.000 people were internally displaced. In total 6.2 million people have been in need of humanitarian assistance.
Agropastoralist communities are affected by droughts in the same way as pastoralist communities. In addition, their livelihood suffers from increased crop failure due to poor soil moisture. This, again, causes agropastoralists to lose their income. Additionally, the local staple food prices rise, putting pressure on people who depend on maize or sorghum as the primary carbohydrate source. 

Similar to higher food prices, drought causes higher water prices as well. Besides fewer available resources to buy quantitative and qualitative adequate food, high water prices lead to poor hygiene practices. In 2017 water shortages due to two consecutive failed rainy seasons led to rising water prices. In the Eastern regions, the cost of 200 litres of water jumped from 2 USD to 7 USD. Similar water shortages during the 2016 drought caused a sharp increase in watery diarrhoea cases to 13.653 cases with a fatality rate of 3.6 %. 
Further consequences of droughts of the last 12 years in Somaliland can be seen in the table below."

\subsection{Political, social and economic circumstances}
region is vulnerable to droughts due to its predominant reliance on pastoralism as its source of livelihood and economy. Livestock remains an essential source of employment, hard currency, export earnings and government revenue.
in case of failure of rainy season, people migrate from their locations, including pastoralists with their livestock, migrate to areas where better water and pasture are still available during the dry season
seasonal weather patterns in the region and the rest of the regions are characterized by four main seasons - two rainy seasons and two dry seasons. The main rains fall during the Gu-season (AprilJune), with lighter and more sporadic rains falling during the Deyr season (October December). Two dry seasons are characterized by one shorter, cooler season, known as the Hagaa (22nd July to 23rd September), and a long, hot, dry season, known as the Jilaal (January to 23rd March), which is the harshest season of the year


Point water sources are the primary source of water
Traditionally, natural disasters like droughts do not prevail uniformly across the entire area of Somalia but only in some hotspots.
significant increase in GBV and child abuse/abandonment during crises such as drought, flooding, conflict, etc. early action includes deploying extra social workers, training community champions, etc. UNFPA and UNICEF are currently undertaking a national assessment of these issues, and the report will likely be a useful source for identifying approaches for undertaking early action as part of the drought FbF

Pastoralism: 
"Is estimated that half of the population in Somalia depends on pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods –Around 6 million people. This population contributes to the livestock trading economy that generates around 500 million USD per year. This accounts for the 79 percent of the total export earnings in the country, and is the largest source of foreign exchange after remittances (World Bank, 2019).In Ethiopia the population of pastoralist is estimated between 12 and 15 million people (UNICEF, 2019)."

“Stakeholders seem to focus exclusively on the portion of the system they perceived.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=73P565M3))
“On the one hand, this allows them to have a clear picture of the evolutionary trends of the different variables that make up that portion of the system” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=ZJSACLXJ))
“On the other hand, due to the limitations of their viewpoint, stakeholders tend to neglect the existence of multiple causes for certain observed phenomena.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=8CUNSCXS))
“Secondly, the data collected shows that the stakeholders tend to aggregate the variables describing the drought impacts, for example the impacts of crop productivity vary dramatically according to the crop under consideration, whereas stakeholders perceived a general reduction in productivity.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=TT7JRW3U))


“This work also demonstrates that there is a lack of synchronism between the stakeholders’ perception and the drought onset.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=H3XRYH3Q))

“In fact, stakeholders become aware of the drought only when they recognize the impacts on their perceived environment.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=869MME8Q))
“Often, those impacts are recognizable only when the drought is at its peak” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=XTTUYS8M))

“Therefore, stakeholders’ indicators cannot be used to detect the drought onset or to assess the duration of the phenomenon” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=C2QMHW76))

“They are more suitable to support the evaluation of the severity of the drought, and particularly of the indirect impacts.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 541](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=19&annotation=K8Z77CBR))

“The results of our experience show that drought perception indicators could be useful for defining thresholds of severity rather than for evaluating drought evolutionary trends. These thresholds could support decision makers in the development of effective drought risk management strategies.” ([Giordano et al., 2013, p. 542](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B7LM5ZR4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/7I66DBIK?page=20&annotation=X47HGTNQ))

"Although birkeds cannot be considered permanent water points in the sense of permanent wells which do not rely on harvesting rainwater, clusters of birkeds represent dry season water points that they provide water throughout the dry season in most years. Today, then, distribution of water points is vastly different from a few decades ago. Map 5 shows the water points that exist today in the five districts under study. The map attempts to show the wells and boreholes as well as the main clusters of birkeds. The latter are difficult to map as there is no existing record of all locations. The map is based on sketch maps drawn by communities during the fieldwork. It is thus not meant to be accurate but to give an indication of the nature of change. It should be noted that these water points shown on the map are also the site of permanent settlements, as the tendency has been for settlements to grow up at the site of new water points."

"Water source:
o Out of 77 communities assessed, 49 have berkets, 26 have boreholes, 21 have shallow
wells, 28 communities reported that they receive water trucking.
o Berkads: 76\% of communities having berkets reported that all berkets are reported to be
depleted, while 22\% reported they were less half than full.
o Water trucking: Out of the 28 communities that receive water trucking, 43\% receive water
on a daily basis. 19 out of 28 communities (68\%) receiving water trucking responded that
they receive water from private suppliers. No communities, covered by this assessment,
mentioned water trucking from humanitarian partners.
o Reduction of water consumption: 54 out of 77 assessed communities (69\%) responded
that the majority of community members reduced water consumption in the past 4 weeks,
including all assessed communities in Sool." https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KWUZW0jEMV1Ijc4zeET_Yes93VJ_3qn2/view

\section{Notes}
% Notes: 
% the literature review is focused on providing background information and enabling historical interpretation of the subject of analysis in relation to the research problem the case is intended to address. This includes synthesizing studies that help to:

% "Place relevant works in the context of their contribution to understanding the case study being investigated. This would include summarizing studies that have used a similar subject of analysis to investigate the research problem. If there is literature using the same or a very similar case to study, you need to explain why duplicating past research is important [e.g., conditions have changed; prior studies were conducted long ago, etc.].
% Describe the relationship each work has to the others under consideration that informs the reader why this case is applicable. Your literature review should include a description of any works that support using the case to study the research problem and the underlying research questions.
% Identify new ways to interpret prior research using the case study. If applicable, review any research that has examined the research problem using a different research design. Explain how your case study design may reveal new knowledge or a new perspective or that can redirect research in an important new direction.
% Resolve conflicts amongst seemingly contradictory previous studies. This refers to synthesizing any literature that points to unresolved issues of concern about the research problem and describing how the subject of analysis that forms the case study can help resolve these existing contradictions.
% Point the way in fulfilling a need for additional research. Your review should examine any literature that lays a foundation for understanding why your case study design and the subject of analysis around which you have designed your study may reveal a new way of approaching the research problem or offer a perspective that points to the need for additional research.
% Expose any gaps that exist in the literature that the case study could help to fill. Summarize any literature that not only shows how your subject of analysis contributes to understanding the research problem, but how your case contributes to a new way of understanding the problem that prior research has failed to do.
% Locate your own research within the context of existing literature [very important!]. Collectively, your literature review should always place your case study within the larger domain of prior research about the problem. The overarching purpose of reviewing pertinent literature in a case study paper is to demonstrate that you have thoroughly identified and synthesized prior studies in the context of explaining the relevance of the case in addressing the research problem."https://libguides.pointloma.edu/c.php?g=944338&p=6806958
