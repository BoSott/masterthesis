conclusion

In the conclusion, you should summarize the key findings you have taken from the literature and emphasize their significance.

The literature review for a case study research paper is generally structured the same as it is for any college-level research paper. The difference, however, is that the literature review is focused on providing background information and enabling historical interpretation of the subject of analysis in relation to the research problem the case is intended to address. This includes synthesizing studies that help to:

"Place relevant works in the context of their contribution to understanding the case study being investigated. This would include summarizing studies that have used a similar subject of analysis to investigate the research problem. If there is literature using the same or a very similar case to study, you need to explain why duplicating past research is important [e.g., conditions have changed; prior studies were conducted long ago, etc.].
Describe the relationship each work has to the others under consideration that informs the reader why this case is applicable. Your literature review should include a description of any works that support using the case to study the research problem and the underlying research questions.
Identify new ways to interpret prior research using the case study. If applicable, review any research that has examined the research problem using a different research design. Explain how your case study design may reveal new knowledge or a new perspective or that can redirect research in an important new direction.
Resolve conflicts amongst seemingly contradictory previous studies. This refers to synthesizing any literature that points to unresolved issues of concern about the research problem and describing how the subject of analysis that forms the case study can help resolve these existing contradictions.
Point the way in fulfilling a need for additional research. Your review should examine any literature that lays a foundation for understanding why your case study design and the subject of analysis around which you have designed your study may reveal a new way of approaching the research problem or offer a perspective that points to the need for additional research.
Expose any gaps that exist in the literature that the case study could help to fill. Summarize any literature that not only shows how your subject of analysis contributes to understanding the research problem, but how your case contributes to a new way of understanding the problem that prior research has failed to do.
Locate your own research within the context of existing literature [very important!]. Collectively, your literature review should always place your case study within the larger domain of prior research about the problem. The overarching purpose of reviewing pertinent literature in a case study paper is to demonstrate that you have thoroughly identified and synthesized prior studies in the context of explaining the relevance of the case in addressing the research problem."https://libguides.pointloma.edu/c.php?g=944338&p=6806958

% The framework for drought impact-based forecasting proposed in the paper "Towards drought impact-based forecasting in a multi-hazard context" aims to provide more comprehensive and actionable information for decision-making in the context of multi-hazard risk management. The framework considers both biophysical and socioeconomic factors, including:

% Exposure: The extent to which a population or system is exposed to drought-related hazards, such as the availability of water resources, the dependence on rain-fed agriculture, and the presence of infrastructure that may be vulnerable to drought-related impacts.

% Vulnerability: The susceptibility of a population or system to drought-related impacts, considering factors such as the social, economic, and environmental characteristics of the affected area, as well as the capacity of the affected community or system to cope with and recover from drought-related impacts.

% Coping capacities: The ability of a population or system to mitigate or adapt to drought-related impacts, including the availability of resources, the presence of social networks and support systems, and the ability to access and utilize information and technology.

% The authors argue that considering these factors in the context of drought forecasting can provide more useful and actionable information for decision-making, and recommend further research on the development and implementation of drought impact-based forecasting systems, as well as their integration into existing decision-making frameworks.

% “Drought presents a clear case for the multi-hazardapproach. Because it is a slow-onsetevent, vulnerability to drought is susceptible to the influenceof concurrent hazards and non-biophysical events, meaning multi-hazards must be considered if drought interventions are to be effectivelytargeted. Moreover, the intrinsic predictability and slow onset provides a timeframe in which early actions can be adapted in response to multi-hazard influences (Boult et al., 2020).” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=2&annotation=QZ7UC62U))

% The main challenges for drought impact-based forecasting (IbF) as described in this text include:

% Difficulty in directly forecasting drought impacts: It can be challenging to establish a functional relationship between drought hazards and impacts, as past humanitarian aid and development may have weakened this link, and sufficient impact data may be unavailable. In addition, the relationship between hazard severity and impact is mediated by vulnerability, which is not always fully understood.

% Issues with predefined systems: Predefined IbF systems that rely on predefined trigger thresholds and pre-agreed actions may not be able to adapt to changing vulnerabilities over time. These systems also rely on expert judgement during system development, which may be subject to bias and may not accurately reflect the complexity of the system.

% “Without scope to accommodate dynamic vulnerabilities, actions cannot be effectively targeted or may prove ineffective.” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=4&annotation=YYURM2E3))

% Lack of coordination between sectors: Drought impacts often involve multiple sectors (e.g. agriculture, water, health), but there may be a lack of coordination and integration between these sectors in the design and implementation of IbF systems. This can lead to inefficiencies and gaps in the response to drought impacts.

% Limited capacity for impact-based decision making: There may be a lack of capacity or resources for impact-based decision making at the local level, particularly in low-income countries where data availability and quality may be limited.

% Inability to fully capture the complexity of drought impacts: Drought impacts often involve complex and dynamic interactions between hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures, and may be exacerbated by non-climate factors such as conflict or economic conditions. It can be difficult to fully capture and understand these interactions in IbF systems.

% “Moreover, if the complex relationships linking multihazards to multi-impacts obscure attribution of particular impacts to particular hazards, hazard-focused organisations may be limited by their institutional mandate and thus unable to act.” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=4&annotation=2XG6YP8D))

% interesting!!! Fig. 1. A hybrid framework for multi-hazard IbF. Refer to the main text for a definition of numbers. Black arrows and numbers: components common across predefined humanitarian IbF systems. Blue arrows and numbers: real-time components. Grids represent spatially varying values. Darker reds indicate higher values of risk, vulnerability, and thresholds. In this example, despite only low to moderate risk in the southwest square, increased dynamic vulnerability lowers the threshold for action, resulting in triggering. Meanwhile, reduced vulnerability in the northern squares elevates trigger thresholds, so the northeast square no longer triggers. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

% A hydrometeorological forecast indicating the likelihood of drought occurring is combined with a predefined assessment of static vulnerability to determine risk. Where static vulnerability is higher (Fig. 1: northern squares), trigger thresholds are lower. 2) Risk is compared to agreed-upon thresholds for action. 3) If risk is greater than or equal to the threshold, early action is triggered to mitigate the worst impacts of drought.

% Proposed Framework:
% --> 1)“A hydrometeorological forecast indicating the likelihood of drought occurring is combined with a predefined assessment of static vulnerability to determine risk. Where static vulnerability is higher (Fig. 1: northern squares), trigger thresholds are lower.
% 2) Risk is compared to agreed-upon thresholds for action.

% “We then propose a number of components to account for dynamic vulnerabilities caused by concurrent hazards:
% 4)Expert judgement is utilised to determine dynamic vulnerabilities. For instance, conflict, pest outbreaks, or recent hydrometeorological events, may act to increase vulnerability to drought in the affected location.
% 5) In locations where vulnerability is elevated (Fig. 1: southwest square), the predefined forecast threshold (“danger level”) is relaxed in order to trigger for less severe droughts. This acknowledges that those with elevated vulnerabilities require support even if drought is only slight. In regions where dynamic vulnerability is lower (Fig. 1: northern squares), the predefined forecast threshold may be raised, to avoid the perception of false alarms if a less severedrought does not have significant impact on food security (the trigger threshold for northern squares is elevated to reflect reduced vulnerability). Balancing of lower thresholds for vulnerable regions against higher thresholds for less vulnerable regions reduces the need for ‘safety nets’, enabling more accurate anticipation of donor costs.
% 6) If risk exceeds the adjusted thresholds, early actions are triggered. Early actions may need to be adapted to account for multihazards.” ([Boult et al., 2022, p. 5](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/B2AQSTYL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/W9TFLH43?page=5&annotation=XV9GPPQF))

%	SUBSECTION 3 Water Source Mapping / Water point mapping
%-----------------------------------
% "In all, mapping presents many benefits, such as:

% It makes easier to integrate data from different sources (surveys, censuses, satellites, etc.) and from different disciplines (social, economic, and environmental data). It also allows the switch to new units of analysis from, for example, administrative boundaries (e.g. state) to ecological boundaries (e.g. basin).
% Maps are a powerful visual tool and are more easily understood by stakeholders, particularly in developing countries.
% The spatial nature of water poverty, such as the distance to the nearest water source or the water supply infrastructure, can also be incorporated easily in a GIS database.
% The allocation of resources can be improved, since geographic targeting is more efficient and cost-effective than to launch an equally expensive universal distribution programme.
% Geo-referenced databases can be enriched by additional data as they become available; and new attributes, such as better details on water quality, can be incorporated into the data structure, ensuring that the relevance of the data is sustained over time.
% Maps can be produced at a number of different resolutions depending on their purpose and the cost of data collection. A coarse resolution or a scale too small neglects the heterogeneity within each unit and provides insufficient detail for decision making, while a fine resolution or a scale too large increases the cost of compiling, managing, and analyzing the data."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_point_mapping

% %% Risk analysis

% "Prioritised hazard and its historical impact.
% Drought is currently the most relevant hazard in Somaliland . Droughts have occurred frequently for the last decades and presented varied impacts (The Somaliland drought rapid assessment report commissioned by the National Drought Committee in January 2022).  The occurrence of droughts has increased over the last years from one in five years to one drought every two years. The majority of the population depends on (agro) pastoral agriculture. Since this type of livelihood depends fundamentally on the natural resources of pasture and water, the local population is highly vulnerable to droughts. 
% According to the International Database for Disasters ( EM DAT) recent droughts in Somaliland occurred in 2004, 2010 to 2011, 2014 to 2017, 2019, and 2021 to 2023. The drought incidents have mainly caused food shortages due to below-average crop production, livestock loss and water shortages. The impacts are also in line with the historical drought impacts of the communities in the Eastern regions of Somaliland, i.e. Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer where communities were consulted in focus group discussions as part of the ongoing FbF project.  Since 2018 there has been a drought in 2019 and the current drought (2020-2023). This is also in line with the historical Combined Drought Index (CDI) data (FAO SWALIM). The CDI is a proven and reliable indicator of drought since it incorporates precipitation, soil moisture and vegetation health. While the country has experienced periodic severe drought conditions over the CDI assessment period from 2002 to 2022, the eastern regions have experienced the most extreme drought conditions, especially in the last two years. Droughts in Somaliland lead to a variety of negative impacts. Chief among them is increased food insecurity. EM DAT  lists food shortage and famine as the principal impact of all droughts since 1987. Furthermore, based on the Food Insecurity Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) data, every drought is associated with substantial spikes in food-insecure populations. For example, the current drought led up to December 2022 to 5.6 million people in or above IPC 3 (crisis). Since 2009, Somaliland has experienced a IPC average between class 2 and 3 (between stressed and crisis), whereby the very western regions Awdal and the eastern regions (Sanaag, Sool and Togdheer) have been most affected reaching IPC classification 3 or worse in almost a quarter of assessment periods (every 2 months). 
% The exact processes which lead to food insecurity due to drought are diverse. In the case of pastoral communities, failed rainy seasons result in livestock and herders having to track longer distances to water sources. These circumstances and lower forage and water availability lead to poor livestock health, increasing livestock deaths and lower birth rates, which can amount to the loss of whole herds. Milk production decreases drastically, which is the reason for the lower diet variability of herders. Furthermore, herders have to sell their animals for lower prices due to their lower body conditions and increased supply. This was the case during the 2017 drought. In some cases, whole herds were lost. The price of milk products increased significantly. At the peak of the drought in 2017, 388.000 children suffered from malnutrition and 895.000 people were internally displaced. In total 6.2 million people have been in need of humanitarian assistance.
% Agropastoralist communities are affected by droughts in the same way as pastoralist communities. In addition, their livelihood suffers from increased crop failure due to poor soil moisture. This, again, causes agropastoralists to lose their income. Additionally, the local staple food prices rise, putting pressure on people who depend on maize or sorghum as the primary carbohydrate source. 

% Similar to higher food prices, drought causes higher water prices as well. Besides fewer available resources to buy quantitative and qualitative adequate food, high water prices lead to poor hygiene practices. In 2017 water shortages due to two consecutive failed rainy seasons led to rising water prices. In the Eastern regions, the cost of 200 litres of water jumped from 2 USD to 7 USD. Similar water shortages during the 2016 drought caused a sharp increase in watery diarrhoea cases to 13.653 cases with a fatality rate of 3.6 %.

% There are three main types of water resources monitoring, used in the water resources management system:
% %% main points:
% local monitoring, performed for solution of specific local problems on a limited part of the water body or the territory;
% global (background) monitoring, performed at man-impact free sites, or on sites with low level of anthropogenic influence. Such monitoring is performed for acquisition of information on steady natural characteristics of environmental components. The background monitoring of water bodies is used for evaluation and/or prognostication of shifts in their state caused by economic activities;
% comprehensive (regime) monitoring performed at the water body observation network for determination of the actual state of the water body, for decision making on efficient use, protection, and restoration of water resources;
% critical or alarm monitoring, performed at sites of high risk for immediate warning about unfavourable situations caused primarily by human activities.
% In the water management system there is also a special type of monitoring for wastewater discharges to the water body."https://echo2.epfl.ch/VICAIRE/mod_4/chapt_5/main.htm

% "As a rule, the following parameters are always monitored:

% Water Temperature.
% Transparency or Turbidity.
% pH.
% Conductivity.
% Dissolved oxygen (DO).
% Total phosphorus.
% Total nitrogen.
% Nitrogen, Ammonia.

% or: collective coverage of the costs

% “Instead of a reimbursement centrally paid by the project, interested water users organised an own reward system by collecting a contribution from several users to reimburse one person recording the water level data. However, a real payment or reward was not necessary, since the intrinsic motivation of the participants seemed to be sufficient when lack of money was overcome.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1597](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=8&annotation=S4IKR9K9))
