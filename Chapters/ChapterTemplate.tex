\section{some other title Drought \& Water security} % irgendwas in Richtung grundlegende Konzepte oder so.. was weiß ich ^^

Water security is a theoretical construct that has emerged in the 21st century to frame the overall water objectives and goals to guide local to global water management and policy development \autocite{sadoffWaterSecurity2020a}. It "links together the web of food, energy, climate, economic growth, and human security challenges that the world economy faces over the next two decades" \autocite[5]{wefBubbleCloseBursting2009}. In more detail, it is about "the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods, ecosystems and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks to people, environments and economies."\autocite{greySinkSwimWater2007}.
Water security integrates therefore economic, social and environmental dimensions into an interconnected and complex system of human and natural relations by addressing risks of too much, too little or poor quality water \autocite{vanbeekWaterSecurityPutting2014, mishraWaterSecurityChanging2021}. Due to the focus of this work, emphasis is placed on factors that decrease water security due to too little water availability. Besides other factors, natural disasters such as droughts, and water scarcity are the main drivers for insufficient quantities of water \autocite{caretta2022water}. Water quality and access are briefly addressed in addition to provide a more comprehensive  understanding of water security for the following chapters.

\subsection{About Drought}\label{subsec:about_drought}

\todo{TODO: change NDMC sources to knew ones}

Drought as highly complex and severe climate-related multi-hazard has far reaching, cascading and interconnected consequences affecting natural ecosystems, societies and economies \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. Historically, droughts are a recurring feature that can occur in all climates. They can geographically extend over small areas to entire sub-continents and are slow onset events that can persist for a few weeks to several years. These high spatial and temporal variabilities make drought not only challenging to define but due to its slow onset, droughts are often only recognized when they are well advanced \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. While some drought conditions over large areas can be associated to some low-frequency changes in atmospheric conditions such as the El Niño, accurate cause identification can be rather challenging on smaller scales and requires many different parameters \autocite{botaiAnalysisDroughtProgression2019, vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

%In order to approach this complexity, drought is most often defined from four different perspectives, focussing on different manifestations and stages. These definitions are outlined in the coming sub-chapter \ref*{subsec:drought_definitions}, followed by a section addressing the necessary indicators  currently employed in practice for these definitions.
%Generally, droughts are commonly characterized by deviations or the complete failure of climate and weather systems that drive the hydrological cycle compared to normal conditions\autocite{botaiAnalysisDroughtProgression2019,idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. A more in depth definition can be found in the sub-chapter \ref*{subsec:drought_definitions}.

%“Many studies characterize drought via three main aspects: (i) intensity, (ii) duration and (iii) spatial coverage (He et al.,2018;Adede et al.,2019;Dai,2011).” ([Balti et al., 2020, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/V9YH9QFQ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/JC4XTVWE?page=3&annotation=WPTV8SEV))
%instead of the first sentence: This complex concept of drought commonly encompassing .... dimensions of interrelated causes ... 

The concept of drought commonly encompasses multiple temporal, spatial and thematic dimensions. This complex conglomeration of interrelated causes and effects makes definition of \textit{droughts} a fairly multi-layered undertaking \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013}. Several well-known definitions (in this category) are for example from the \autocite{theamericanheritagedictionaryoftheenglishlanguageDrought2022} defining drought as "a long period of abnormally low rainfall, especially one that adversely affects growing or living conditions". \autocite[2]{palmerMeteorologicalDrought1965} defines drought as "a prolonged and abnormal moisture deficiency." or \autocite{vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016} defines droughts simply as "an exceptional lack of water compared to normal conditions". Other drought definitions emphasize its natural and/or human origin, its special characteristics, impact and temporal duration or even understand "drought as a system of causality where the link between causes and effects is random in nature {balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020, idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,loonDroughtAnthropocene2016, wangPropagationDroughtMeteorological2016, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. Already in the 1980s, \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985} found more than 150 published definitions of drought. Besides the categorization into a conceptual or operational category , \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985} proposed a clustering of these definitions into four types, namely meteorological drought, agricultural drought, hydrological drought and socio-economic drought. This classification is still widespread today \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

The conceptual category refers to a general formulation of an idea of drought to understand its concept and identify its boundaries and is often formulated in relative terms \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. Definitions in the operational category try to define how drought functions in terms of its onset, duration, severity and spatial coverage also covering how this can be measured via indices \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, nationaldroughtmitigationcenterWhatDrought, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. With these definitions, the current situation is usually compared to a historical average, which is usually based on a 30-year period, which presupposes the development and continuous measurement of indicators and indices that can be used. \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The four types of drought are commonly conceptually defined and brought into practice by operational specifications. They can be understood as different, but complementary stages of the same process and are generally cascading in reason and time but can overlap and are difficult to completely unravel. Figure \todo{TODO:, see https://drought.unl.edu/Education/DroughtIn-depth/TypesofDrought.aspx} shows an overview about the different types, their succession and cascading elements and table \todo{TODO: see RCRC 2020 p.11} displays the four types at a glance.

\missingfigure{This is just a test.}

The \textit{meteorological drought} is usually characterized by the duration and the degree of dryness in comparison to the normal average amount and try to conceptually understand how weather patterns can impact water availability. These definitions are specific for a regions atmospheric conditions, e.g. regions with a year-round precipitations regime such as tropical rainforest need different definitions and thresholds than e.g. climates characterized by seasonal rainfall patterns \autocite{nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought}. Operational categorization mostly involves using precipitation, moisture, temperature and wind indicators to determine the onset, severity, and duration of the drought.

\textit{Agricultural drought} definitions establish a connection between different features of meteorological drought with their impacts on agriculture. Soil-moisture, differences between actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil water deficits are some of the operationalized indicators for monitoring this type of drought \autocite{baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The type of \textit{hydrological drought} is associated with the impact of meteorological drought on surface or subsurface water resources such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Hydrological drought occurs when these indicators drop below normal levels \autocite{palmerMeteorologicalDrought1965}. The fastest responding indicator of this type of drought is most often the variability of streamflow. The water levels of lakes and groundwater usually lag behind the occurrence of the meteorological or agricultural drought which is why the hydrological drought is often out of phase with the previously mentioned types. The hydrological drought is commonly defined on the basis of watershed or river basin scale \autocite{baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The \textit{socioeconomic drought} differs from the aforementioned types as it can also incorporate features of these types of drought to associate them with the demand and supply of some social or economic good. It therefore relates the impact of all other types of droughts on human population and its various sectors of society such as food security, health, and the economy. It is therefore sometimes also interchangeably used with drought impacts. Operational categorization involves using socioeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates and food prices to assess the severity and duration of the drought \autocite{nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

\missingfigure{This is just a test.}

The shown economic, social and environmental impacts of drought in figure \todo{TODO:} depend on the severity of, and the risk to drought. These three concepts of impact, severity and risk are interrelated concepts used to assess and understand the effects of drought on various sectors. 

\todo{TODO: insert definitions of severity, risk and impact}
% definitions of severity, risk and impact --> short! two sentences! not more -> severity is not that important, impact comes later again and risk as well so let's get going.


Thereby, in alignment with the definition of \autocite{vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016} it is the exceptional severity of the water shortage that distinguishes drought from aridity, a ordinarily recurrent or fully dry climate, and from water scarcity as a long-term "supply/demand and natural and/or human-made phenomenon" \autocites[7]{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021, vanClimatologicalRiskDroughts2017}. Water scarcity is described in more detail in the following chapter \ref*{subsec:water_scarcity}.

Water scarcity, as for drought or water security, is defined in many different ways. The sixth IPCC Assessment Report defines water scarcity broadly as "a mismatch between the demand for fresh water and its availability, quantified in physical terms" \autocite[560]{caretta2022water}. Here, social and economic components are outsourced to the broader concept of water security and insecurity, focussing primarily on physical water scarcity \autocite{caretta2022water}. In contrast, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations defines water scarcity as "a gap between available supply and expressed demand of freshwater in a specified domain, under prevailing institutional arrangements (including both resource ‘pricing’ and retail charging arrangements) and infrastructural conditions" \autocite[5]{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012} further summarizing that water security is "an excess of water demand over available supply" \autocite[6]{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012}. Thus, highlighting the human dimension of this interactive and relative concept of physical and economic water scarcity. Hereby, physical water scarcity refers to a situation in which there is not enough water available in quantitative terms to meet demand whereas economic water scarcity occurs when inadequate infrastructure, institutional or financial capital obstructs access to water resources "even though water in nature is available to meet human demands" \autocites{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}[11]{moldenWaterFoodWater2007}.
Water scarcity and drought are in a complex interrelationship with each other. A short overview about the key differences between water scarcity and drought are given in table \todo{TODO:“Table 1. Characteristics and impacts of water scarcity and drought” ([IDMP, 2022, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/LNSL8VD2)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/JM82W3ZF?page=9&annotation=QNC4A3FG))}.

(2011) DROUGHT AND WATER SCARCITY – DEFINITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/JM82W3ZF?page=9&annotation=E3EQRILA))

Furthermore, potential mutual reinforcements, climate change, increased water use and poor water management can make it sometimes difficult to clearly separate these concepts \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,lealfilhoUnderstandingResponsesClimaterelated2022,liuWaterScarcityAssessments2017,rcrcFORECASTBASEDFINANCINGEARLY2020}. Nonetheless, following the definition of \autocite{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012} the concept of water scarcity always gives water shortage a human dimension in particular on the demand side. The quality of policies, planning and management on the demand side can be seen as critical to the overall severity of the impact of water scarcity \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,faoCopingWaterScarcity2012,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. The supply side can be influenced by human activities, but it is not a mandatory prerequisite. \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}. 

Besides the already mentioned water scarcity on the basis of physical quantity and economical factors, water scarcity can also be caused by water of unacceptable quality and lack of access to water services \autocite{faoCopingWaterScarcity2012}. Acknowledging water quality induced water scarcity as an additional factor is only a relatively new development in literature \autocite{liuThreedimensionalWaterScarcity2020} but together with inadequate access highlights further challenges in ensuring water security \autocite{caretta2022water, mishraWaterSecurityChanging2021}.
