\section{Drought \& Water security} % and water scarcity or water security?

Water security is a theoretical construct that has emerged in the 21st century to frame the overall water objectives and goals to guide local to global water management and policy development \autocite{sadoffWaterSecurity2020a}. "Water security can be described as the fundamental societal goal of water policy and management" \autocite{sadoffWaterSecurity2020a} that "links together the web of food, energy, climate, economic growth, and human security challenges that the world economy faces over the next two decades" \autocite[5]{wefBubbleCloseBursting2009}. Furthermore, it is about "the availability of an acceptable quantity and quality of water for health, livelihoods, ecosystems and production, coupled with an acceptable level of water-related risks to people, environments and economies."\autocite{greySinkSwimWater2007}.
Water security integrates therefore economic, social and environmental dimensions into an interconnected and complex system of human and natural relations \autocite{vanbeekWaterSecurityPutting2014}.



This chapter lays a theoretical background understanding for the context this work is applied in. Here, droughts as a highly complex and severe climate-related multi-hazard has far reaching, cascading and interconnected consequences affecting natural ecosystems, societies and economies \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. Historically, droughts are a recurring feature that can occur in all climates. They can geographically extend over small areas to entire sub-continents and are slow onset events that can persist for a few weeks to several years. These high spatial and temporal variabilities make drought not only challenging to define but due to its slow onset, droughts are often only recognized when they are well advanced \autocite{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. While some drought conditions over large areas can be associated to some low-frequency changes in atmospheric conditions such as the El Ni√±o, accurate cause identification can be rather challenging on smaller scales and requires many different parameters \autocite{botaiAnalysisDroughtProgression2019, vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.
In order to approach this complexity, drought is most often defined from four different perspectives, focussing on different manifestations and stages. These definitions are outlined in the coming sub-chapter \ref*{subsec:drought_definitions}, followed by a section addressing the necessary indicators  currently employed in practice for these definitions.

\subsection{Drought definitions, key terms and concepts}\label{subsec:drought_definitions}

The concept of drought commonly encompasses multiple temporal, spatial and thematic dimensions. This complex conglomeration of interrelated causes and effects makes definition of \textit{droughts} a fairly multi-layered undertaking \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013}. Several well-known definitions (in this category) are for example from the \autocite{publishersDrought2022} defining drought as "a long period of abnormally low rainfall, especially one that adversely affects growing or living conditions". \autocite[2]{palmerMeteorologicalDrought1965} defines drought as "a prolonged and abnormal moisture deficiency." or \autocite{vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016} defines droughts simply as "an exceptional lack of water compared to normal conditions". 

Other drought definitions emphasize its natural and/or human origin, its special characteristics, impact and temporal duration or even understand "drought as a system of causality where the link between causes and effects is random in nature {balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020, idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,loonDroughtAnthropocene2016, wangPropagationDroughtMeteorological2016, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. Already in the 1980s, \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985} found more than 150 published definitions of drought. Besides the categorization into a conceptual or operational category , \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985} proposed a clustering of these definitions into four types, namely meteorological drought, agricultural drought, hydrological drought and socio-economic drought. This classification is still widespread today \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

The conceptual category refers to a general formulation of an idea of drought to understand its concept and identify its boundaries and is often formulated in relative terms \autocite{wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. Definitions in the operational category try to define how drought functions in terms of its onset, duration, severity and spatial coverage also covering how this can be measured via indices \autocite{balintMonitoringDroughtCombined2013, nationaldroughtmitigationcenterWhatDrought, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}. With these definitions, the current situation is usually compared to a historical average, which is usually based on a 30-year period, which presupposes the development and continuous measurement of indicators and indices that can be used. \autocite{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The four types of drought are commonly conceptually defined and brought into practice by operational specifications. They can be understood as different, but complementary stages of the same process and are generally cascading in reason and time but can overlap and are difficult to completely unravel. Figure \todo{TODO:, see https://drought.unl.edu/Education/DroughtIn-depth/TypesofDrought.aspx} shows an overview about the different types, their succession and cascading elements and table \todo{TODO: see RCRC 2020 p.11} displays the four types at a glance.

\missingfigure{This is just a test.}

The \textit{meteorological drought} is usually characterized by the duration and the degree of dryness in comparison to the normal average amount and try to conceptually understand how weather patterns can impact water availability. These definitions are specific for a regions atmospheric conditions, e.g. regions with a year-round precipitations regime such as tropical rainforest need different definitions and thresholds than e.g. climates characterized by seasonal rainfall patterns \autocite{nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought}. Operational categorization mostly involves using precipitation, moisture, temperature and wind indicators to determine the onset, severity, and duration of the drought.

\textit{Agricultural drought} definitions establish a connection between different features of meteorological drought with their impacts on agriculture. Soil-moisture, differences between actual and potential evapotranspiration and soil water deficits are some of the operationalized indicators for monitoring this type of drought \autocite{baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought, wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The type of \textit{hydrological drought} is associated with the impact of meteorological drought on surface or subsurface water resources such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Hydrological drought occurs when these indicators drop below normal levels \autocite{palmerMeteorologicalDrought1965}. The fastest responding indicator of this type of drought is most often the variability of streamflow. The water levels of lakes and groundwater usually lag behind the occurrence of the meteorological or agricultural drought which is why the hydrological drought is often out of phase with the previously mentioned types. The hydrological drought is commonly defined on the basis of watershed or river basin scale \autocite{baltiReviewDroughtMonitoring2020,nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

The \textit{socioeconomic drought} differs from the aforementioned types as it can also incorporate features of these types of drought to associate them with the demand and supply of some social or economic good. It therefore relates the impact of all other types of droughts on human population and its various sectors of society such as food security, health, and the economy. Operational categorization involves using socioeconomic indicators such as unemployment rates and food prices to assess the severity and duration of the drought \autocite{nationaldroughtmitigationcenterTypesDrought,wilhiteUnderstandingDroughtPhenomenon1985}.

\missingfigure{This is just a test.}

The shown economic, social and environmental impacts of drought in figure \todo{TODO:} depend on the severity of, and the risk to the drought. These three concepts of impact, severity and risk are interrelated concepts used to assess and understand the effects of drought on various sectors. Hereby, also following the definition of \autocite{vanloonDroughtHumanmodifiedWorld2016} it is the exceptional severity of the water shortage that distinguishes drought from aridity, a ordinarily recurrent or fully dry climate, and from water scarcity as a long-term "supply/demand and natural and/or human-made phenomenon" \autocites[7]{idmpDroughtWaterScarcity2022}{vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021, vanClimatologicalRiskDroughts2017}. Water scarcity is described in more detail in the following chapter \ref*{subsec:water_scarcity}.
