\section{Introduction}
\# Overview
\#\# Motivation: Importance of Drought + local users

With the projection of rising frequency and intensity of droughts throughout vast parts of the African continent, measures for prediction, monitoring and evidence based management become ever more important \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,adelekanAfricaClimateChange2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}. Somaliland, being no exception to the above mentioned trend, is characterized by droughts with far reaching impacts on ecological, economic, and social aspects . Defined by a semi-arid, four-season climate with two extensive dry seasons and an economic backbone of pastoralism and rain-fed agriculture, water accessibility is of key importance in Somaliland \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,petrucciLandscapeLandformsNorthern2022,republicofsomalilandSomalilandCountryProfile2021}. \newline

Multiple physically based drought forecasts exist for makro- and international levels, fine grained up-to-date forecasts which not only include physical but also social circumstances and knowledge on local levels are often scarce or even non-existent \todo[fancyline]{sources}. "However, assessments focused only on physical variables and processes fail to capture why drought matters [...]."\autocite[3]{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}, how it impacts communities and which mitigation strategies are locally taken \todo{source?}.\newline

\#\#\# EAP and FbF
To better anticipate and prevent negative impacts on Communities world wide, the international Red Cross Red Crescent Movement started the new dogma of Forecast based Financing in order to facilitate Anticipatory Actions to mitigate impact before it happens. 

stuff about FbF and EAP (recylce eap work for Klonner?)


Besides the further development of more fine grained technical solutions the integration of local knowledge is another way forward. Giving local people and communities an active voice and co-produce knowledge with them can yield multiple benefits for the communities affected and enrich resulting data quality. 

neben traditionelleren Ansätzen der Befragung und Entwicklung systematischeren Managements, Crowdsensing ist ein moderner, mittlerweile weitläufig getesteter Ansatz der lokalen und zeitnahen Wissens- und Datenerhebung. Challenges etc..

One way of integrating local knowledge into real-time drought monitoring is Crowdsensing



Direct feedback and communication from and with volunteers or community members remains a challenge in the joint management of hazards and risks. The tasks are numerous and need to take into consideration different aspects, ranging from cultural differences to different background knowledge and technical capabilities and capacities. The IFRC states, that the "community engagement and accountability (CEA) is essential […] to build acceptance and trust” (IFRC n.d.) for effective and sustainable outcomes. Furthermore, a case study in Senegal has clearly illustrated the value of community knowledge in anticipatory action (Start Network 2022). However, the monthly surveys for data collection were laborious, limited in number and space and hence not feasible on a larger scale.

To not only integrate lokal knowledge into scientific works but to co-produce findings

\#\#\# case study (?) + current situation and general information and current tools (?)
(establish your research territory: general information about the importance, background details to understand studies context)


\#\#\# Importance of local knowledge and integration of the community

Providing a technical solution that enables mutual contact between communities and the Somalia Red Crescent Society (SRCS) in a simple and accessible way would make it possible to collect this most helpful information. By ensuring that sovereignty over the collected data rests with the community, the decision-making power and benefits remain with those concerned. Therefore, in the development and application of an Early Action Protocol (EAP) in the context of Forecast based Action (FbA) in Somalia, the technical aspect in particular holds great potential to benefit numerous communities over the long term.


While there is a comparatively good basis with regard to the general availability of data on social, economic and natural information and conditions, as well as their spatial and qualitative characteristics, the timeliness of this information varies greatly. Especially in the context of Anticipatory Action, time is of the essence and a swift action based on up-to-date data is crucial. Gathering and incorporating local knowledge through manual surveys by a central organisation can be of great value, as shown above, but is time-consuming and slow.


\#\#\# value of this study
(justifying your niche - why the research is needed. -> how Gap)

The benefits of overcoming this temporal handicap by providing a simple and accessible tool for the SRCS’s large network of volunteers can already be seen in the Community Based Surveillance (CBS) programme. The CBS is a pioneering technical approach to disease outbreak surveillance in Somalia and was developed as part of the SRCS Health Strategy 2019-2023. In this process, “volunteers report health risks through their respective locations and send to the SRCS data platform […]” (SRCS 2022:57) through coded SMS. So far, 315 volunteers from 115 villages have specifically been trained. In at least two cases, an outbreak could be contained thanks to early detection (SRCS 2021, 2022). On top of this already proven application, further functions could be added as needed.

\#\#\# key aims and objectives
(explain the significance of your study -> how the research was conducted -> value of the study)
Statement of objectives. Clearly and concisely, what are the general goals of the
thesis. Each thesis may have distinct goals. For instance, is your thesis project purely
descriptive of a new phenomena? Is it empirically testing causal relationships
between particular variables of interest? Adocumentclassre your providing a critical evaluation of a
particular topic or framework? Are you providing a new perspective by presenting a
new typology? Are you creating, implementing, or testing a new research tool? Any
such missions of the thesis should be clearly stated in this section.
• Significance of the project. What is the social importance of this thesis. That is, how
will this thesis aid our collective understanding of emerging media, in terms of
theory and real-world application to a particular social domain (e.g., politics, health,
entertainment, design).

The practical implementation will be based on a database and the integration of communication possibilities but could be further extended by creating visualisation and information capabilities such as a web map. On the other hand, the ability not only to receive messages but also to send messages or information to volunteers based on certain criteria, e.g. their location, could be a useful feature in the context of the uses mentioned above. Other possibilities for analysis or planning purposes, such as calculating accessibility by integrating Openrouteservice (ORS) functionality, could be future enhancements.

\#\#\# research questions and working hypothesis
(Write down at least 3 principal hypotheses that you would like to defend/verify/falsify in your thesis (it is possible that you will finally test slightly different ones during your research). You should be able to formulate hypotheses even for narrative/theoretical topics. If you have difficulties with identifying 2-3 reasonable hypotheses then your topic has no contents and you might consider changing it for somethig more reasonable.
1.	Hypothesis \#1:
2.	Hypothesis \#2:
3.	Hypothesis \#3:
4.	Other hypotheses:
)


The final report of the FbF feasibility study identifies six hazards, namely drought, flood, cyclone, disease, locusts and conflict. Of these six hazards, drought was ranked as the greatest threat due to its increasing frequency, severity and wide-ranging consequences. Community engagement in determining early action was also rated as 'critical', with SRCS volunteers and community emergency response teams suggested as the most important resource for this process (SRCS 2022).

Extending this idea of engagement to the longer term after the initial design has been completed, the monitoring of water sources, their quality and their accessibility could be an interesting and important point to pursue. To illustrate the practical benefits, one could imagine a case study where volunteers could provide monthly information on the number, quality, and accessibility of water sources for the community. They could enter this information directly into the tool or submit it via coded SMS. Based on this information, an actual drought indicator or even a vulnerability indicator could be developed. Evaluation or feedback mechanisms would also be conceivable instead, as well as use by the community itself.
