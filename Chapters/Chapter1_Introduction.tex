--> starting point
% mayyybeeee just mayyybe write that the first tow objectives and research questions are interim results and are addressed during the study, whereas the third and fourth objective/question is only discussed at the end.

Overview: 7 Common Introduction Mistakes
1. Not providing sufficient context for the study
-> sufficient contextual foundation (literature and real world)
-> what, where, who, when
-> what the fk is going on! -> foundation for research justification
write for the intelligent layman (intellectual curious but not an expert)
start from the bottom

2. Not presenting a strong justification for the research topic
justify research aims (not only: it hasn't been done before -> originality is important but not the only thing)
-> discuss novelty of the project
-> also the practical and theoretical importance (more research in the global south)
(a) What are you researching (and how is this novel/original)?
(b) Why is it important (will add value to the field)?
(c) Who is going to benefit from the research or who will struggle without it?

3. Having a research topic that’s too broad
-> not too broad
-> tightly define the research \textbf{aim}


4. Having poorly defined research aims, objectives and research questions
-> aim, objectives and questions


5. Having misaligned research aims, objectives and research questions


6. Not having well-defined and/or justified scope
narrow scope and specify boundaries
where, when, who --> focused, manageable, replicable
-> justify scope
-> mention how much research has already been undertaken in the research area of interest
-> say one it hasn't been done (could have been done, but as I know from I2, publications are rare)

7. Not providing a clear structural outline of the document
-> detailed and clear outline of the thesis, -> document structure -> orient the reader -> where to find stuff
does not need to be lengthy -> a line or two for each chapter

% Hazards and Drought

With the projection of rising frequency and intensity of droughts throughout vast parts of the African continent, measures for prediction, monitoring and evidence based anticipatory actions and management become ever more important \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,adelekanAfricaClimateChange2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

% from global to regional (horn of Africa) to local (Somalia - Somaliland)

“Somaliland is characterized by drought” ([Abdulkadir, 2017, p. 104172233225941010000](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/G2RYLAC4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/5PPIPUKD?page=1&annotation=PTQSFYGD))






% case study - would fit better in the other way around (as the TH)
Somaliland, being no exception to the above mentioned climatic trend, is characterized by droughts with far reaching impacts on ecological, economic, and social aspects. Defined by a semi-arid, four-season climate with two extensive dry seasons and an economic backbone of pastoralism and rain-fed agriculture, water accessibility is of key importance in Somaliland \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,petrucciLandscapeLandformsNorthern2022,republicofsomalilandSomalilandCountryProfile2021}.
In addition, the final report of the FbF feasibility study identifies five other hazards besides droughts, namely flood, cyclone, disease, locusts and conflict. Of all these hazards, drought was ranked as the greatest threat due to its increasing frequency, severity and wide-ranging consequences.\newline

% historic events -> from the past to the present (response) to the future (anticipatory)
“Spotlight on Somalia: Can we learn from failure? In Somalia in 2011, a famine was declared that, along with the complexity of the conflict situation, was responsible for thousands of deaths. At its peak, almost 4 in every 10 children in Southern Somalia were acutely malnourished, and 4 million people were estimated to be without basic food. The horror of this tragedy has since haunted the international community, who received 11 months of early warnings before a famine was declared. Beginning with La Nina forecasts almost one year in advance, FEWS-NET and others provided briefing notes and warning information to humanitarian actors in the region. Several months later, these alerts explained that rainy seasons had already failed, and that major impacts were extremely likely (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012). There has been a great deal of analysis of this event, in which several conclusions have come to light. One is that funding needs to be more readily available based on forecasted information (Lautze et al. 2012). The below graph (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012) demonstrates how large-scale funding was mobilized in the aftermath of the famine declaration, and was ultimately available after the most vulnerable had died. Secondly, the humanitarian community needs to clearly take responsibility for acting in advance of a disaster, even in complex cases like the Somali context. At the moment, such organizations are not held accountable for failure to act on early warning, as disaster response is considered business-asusual. Shouldering the responsibility to act in this critical moment between a warning and a disaster could avoid such impacts in the future (Lautze et al. 2012).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/WKFPUZCW?page=7&annotation=LIY2ABLI))

“The number of affected people will be 1,200,420 persons across all the six main regions in Somaliland. The top priority needs of the people affected to date are mainly water (70{\%), Food (21\%) and Health (9\%).” ([National Drought Committee, 2022, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/7XJRE6LM)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2F59E4UZ?page=3&annotation=8JZVBSM6))

%	SECTION 2 Focus and Scope
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
narrow, pin point
% After a brief introduction to your general area of interest, narrow your focus and define the scope of your research.

% You can narrow this down in many ways, such as by:

% Geographical area
% Time period
% Demographics or communities
% Themes or aspects of the topic
% transition: this will help to tackle worsening situation

% ground truthing
% local impact forecasts
% local knowledge (while it could integrate local knowledge more, this work will only touch this topic)
% Volunteersensing
% mapping and monitoring with Crowdsensing
% EAP & AAs & trigger



% Early Actions / Anticipatory Actions / FbF

In order to meet this challenge, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement together with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center started the Forecast-based Financing (FbF) programme in 2007 to facilitate Anticipatory Actions instead of post-disaster reactions. Together with their local partners, the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is working on establishing so called Early Action Protocols (EAPs) to ensure better organization and coordination of Anticipatory Actions in the face of an incoming hazard. These actions are based on a predefined interplay of forecast, trigger and financing mechanisms to ensure rapid, scientific based responses.

% based on forecasts -> Forecasts
% drought forecasts
Existing drought forecasts and trigger indicators are mostly based on physical indicators and cover especially macro- and international levels, e.g. EDDI, SPI, SPEI \todo{look them up + which forecast is defined by the SRCS?}. Fine grained up-to-date forecasts which not only include physical but also social circumstances and knowledge on local levels are often scarce or even non-existent \todo[fancyline]{sources}. "However, assessments focused only on physical variables and processes fail to capture why drought matters [...]."\autocite[3]{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}, how it impacts communities and which mitigation strategies are locally taken \todo{source?}.\newline

“The tools also tend to ignore the at risk community who happen to be host to very crucial traditional knowledge on droughts” ([Masinde and Bagula, 2010, p. 390](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/JNC4ACZS)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/IWMKDQYV?page=1&annotation=VUYYP2LA))

% local knowledge
% ahh well.. maybe cut this down a bit. Local knowledge was not that important in the end..  
Besides the further development of more fine grained technical solutions the integration of local knowledge is another way forward. Engaging local people and communities and giving them an active voice in defining and co-producing anticipatory actions and knowledge can be of multiple benefit to communities and enrich the data generated \autocite{somaliredcrescentsocietyFeasibilityStudyPotential2022, njambi-szlapkaIntegratingCommunityVoices}\todo{source}. On the one hand, citizens can help to fill data gaps of categorized measurements such as simple assessments of dry-to-wet conditions which correspond to the above mentioned technical drought indicators \autocite{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}. On the other hand, citizens can contribute their local knowledge which can potentially draw on years of experience, encompass a wide range of aspects and give them a feeling of co-owning which in itself can already bring many advantages \autocite{njambi-szlapkaIntegratingCommunityVoices}\todo{source}. The IFRC states, that the "community engagement and accountability (CEA) is essential […] to build acceptance and trust” \autocite{ifrcCommunityEngagementAccountability}(IFRC n.d.) for effective and sustainable outcomes. 
Nonetheless, direct contributions and communication from and with volunteers or community members remain a challenge in the joint management of hazards and risks. The tasks are numerous and need to take into consideration different aspects, ranging from cultural differences to different background knowledge and technical capabilities and capacities.



% specify, thought that this would be about the methodology
Qualitative interviews can capture a wide range of local contribution, knowledge and information but are very labour intensive, often limited in time and hence not feasible on larger scale for monitoring purposes.

% CS
“Involving stakeholders in the co-creation of WS assessment tools [38] could help increase the legitimacy and salience of data. Local knowledge should be incorporated into citizen science strategies: people are sources of information but they also generate a common understanding of water dynamics in the context of the socio-ecological processes involved. Co-creation will facilitate the communication of WS data in a harmonised and aggregated way that improves decision making based on real scenarios with actively involved and engaged stakeholders [13,22,91,108].” ([Butte et al., 2022, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QB97YZ2M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/Q936I2JN?page=10&annotation=JNYCQVSA))

“Stakeholders should not be seen only as information receivers but also as active players in the identification of information needs [150].” ([Butte et al., 2022, p. 13](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QB97YZ2M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/Q936I2JN?page=13&annotation=9GZ2FNKW))

“With the advance of citizen science over the last decade, amateurs and non-experts from local communities have contributed in the various steps of the data cycle, from collection to analysis and interpretation” ([Butte et al., 2022, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QB97YZ2M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/Q936I2JN?page=7&annotation=E5NG5FU6))
“Previous studies have demonstrated the advantages of citizen science in: capturing data during episodic flooding events [56], gathering water related data over data-poor regions, especially in the Global South [57], and collecting information related to previous years, where historical data might be missing.” ([Butte et al., 2022, p. 7](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QB97YZ2M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/Q936I2JN?page=7&annotation=EPZWNPJ6))

citizen science in the field of water monitoring: rivers, lakes, groundwater but hardly ever any direct drinking sources for early actions
for the first part: compare introduction of: “Citizen science projects in freshwater monitoring. From individual design to clusters?” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=1&annotation=6IJERY2C))


“This shift is reflected globally through policy initiatives of the United Nations such as Agenda 21 or the Aarhus Convention which emphasize that “the serious environmental, social, and economic challenges faced by societies worldwide cannot be addressed by public authorities alone” (UNECE, 2008).” ([Weston and Conrad, 2015, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/49HXDHSH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/CCHM5SNH?page=1&annotation=DEWMV6FY))

“Figure 4. The figur” ([Butte et al., 2022, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QB97YZ2M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/Q936I2JN?page=6&annotation=LGYJQ9CS))

This works follows the “general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=2&annotation=BTE2JFKV)) which is basically “community-based monitoring, which also explicitly focuses on the public ’s involvement in monitoring processes” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=2&annotation=K4URWWLV))

\autocite[20]{gualazziniEWEAEarlyWarning2021} highlights the value of \acrshort{cbm} triangulated data as it ensures the consideration of local perspective in "high-level aggregated data and early action decision-making processes" and decentralises disaster management. 


“Furthermore it is an interesting communication tool in the light of science communication. Correspondingly water managers should be interested in participatory monitoring in the light of integrated water management.” ([Minkman, 2015, p. 199](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/ZKLE6CPT)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/QMAPCSZG?page=199&annotation=GHI9KSDA))


“Local citizens are seen as essential participants in collaborative environmental management because they can provide vital information about the area’s natural and sociopolitical systems as well as support for measures to address non–point source pollution” ([Koehler and Koontz, 2008, p. 143](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/2PKW9CYX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/YYG4JK3R?page=1&annotation=MV6JAERB))


“Within these citizen science projects, monitoring mainly focuses on rivers (48%) but also considers lakes (26%), groundwater (12.57%), and estuaries (13.33%)” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=4&annotation=QGL5N2BA))
% while there are lots of hydrological monitoring stuff out there (mostly crowdsensing in the case of water + focused on health by CBS), there is none, that looks at drinking water source monitoring direktly by applying the proven sets of methods on a new topic in a new environment (not North America but resource scarce environments from the perspective of an NGO (SRCS)) 
“Citizen scientists measure physical (34.22%, e.g., temperature, turbidity, color), chemical (34.76%, e.g., pH, nitrates, phosphates, dissolved oxygen), biological (22.99%, e.g., fecal coliform bacteria, algae, aquatic macroinvertebrates), and some other parameters (8.02%, e.g., macro/microplastic pollution, riparian habitat), demonstrating the diverse tasks citizen scientists engage in. Citizen scientists further measure these parameters rather ‘regularly’ (82.93%) than ‘sometimes only’ (17.07%), indicating continuity and thus a substantial contribution of citizens to the monitoring process.” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=4&annotation=6GC8UE8I))

% benefits
Providing a technical solution that enables mutual contact between communities and the Somalia Red Crescent Society (SRCS) in a simple and accessible way would make it possible to collect this most helpful information. By ensuring that sovereignty over the collected data rests with the community, the decision-making power and benefits remain with those concerned. Therefore, in the development and application of an Early Action Protocol (EAP) in the context of Forecast based Action (FbA) in Somalia, the technical aspect in particular holds great potential to benefit numerous communities over the long term.

While there is a comparatively good basis with regard to the general availability of data on social, economic and natural information and conditions, as well as their spatial and qualitative characteristics, the timeliness of this information varies greatly. Especially in the context of Anticipatory Action, time is of the essence and a swift action based on up-to-date data is crucial. Gathering and incorporating local knowledge through manual surveys by a central organisation can be of great value, as shown above, but is time-consuming and slow.


--> highlight the pro of this work
"The highly localized information provided by observers can fill drought monitoring gaps by ground-truthing quantitative indicators and offering information in places where other monitoring tools may not exist. Overall, the research team found that strategic investments in time and funding can help fill in geographic and temporal gaps in drought monitoring information through volunteer observations."

% Start by giving a brief overview of the current state of research. You should definitely cite the most relevant literature, but remember that you will conduct a more in-depth survey of relevant sources in the literature review section, so there’s no need to go too in-depth in the introduction.

% Depending on your field, the importance of your research might focus on its practical application (e.g., in policy or management) or on advancing scholarly understanding of the topic (e.g., by developing theories or adding new empirical data). In many cases, it will do both.

% Ultimately, your introduction should explain how your thesis or dissertation:

% Helps solve a practical or theoretical problem
% Addresses a gap in the literature
% Builds on existing research
% Proposes a new understanding of your topic

%technical feasibility: important here? --> make this the state of the research
The benefits of overcoming the high labour costs and the temporal handicap by providing a simple and accessible tool for the SRCS’s large network of volunteers can already be seen in other comparable contexts using the Community Based Surveillance (CBS) programme, its successor NYSS, the Ushahidi platform or tools like Social.Water, ITIKI and CoCoRaHS \autocite{fienenSocialWaterCrowdsourcing2012a} \todo{sources}. The CBS is a pioneering technical approach to disease outbreak surveillance in Somalia and was developed as part of the SRCS Health Strategy 2019-2023. In this process, “volunteers report health risks through their respective locations and send to the SRCS data platform […]” \autocite[57]{somaliredcrescentsocietyFeasibilityStudyPotential2022} through coded SMS. So far, 315 volunteers from 115 villages have specifically been trained. In at least two cases, an outbreak could be contained thanks to early detection (SRCS 2021, 2022). On top of this already proven application, further functions could be added as needed.
Social.Water, ITIKI and CoCoRaHS are environmental data collection and drought monitoring implementations. These approaches are based on Crowdsensing approaches and partly employ more sophisticated technical solutions via internet connections, wireless sensor networks or photographs and have been implemented and tested in recent studies or ongoing monitoring programmes. While suggesting that the method of Crowdsensing for data collection and monitoring is fit for purpose, these approaches are not feasible to this context due to internet connection and technical equipment requirements, lack of categorization or their focus on just environmental data acquisition without taking sufficient account of the impact on the community impact and social realities.

“Citizen science programmes are promising cost-efficient methods to monitor environmental resources, which make them especially suitable for low-income countries to overcome their sparse data resolution.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1598](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=9&annotation=4E9JCTQ5))

% keeping data up to date is crucial in ensuring correct vulnerability and exposure data 
“Vulnerability and exposure changes over time, particularly after an extreme weather or climate event. Datasets must be kept up to date to ensure the impact-based forecast or warning using this data is reliable. Recognise that many official governmental data sources, such as a national census or demographic and health surveys, are updated infrequently – every five or ten years.” ([Harrowsmith et al., 2020, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QJ397Y54)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/2GS362N5?page=28&annotation=5XVAQCTY))

“Intervening early to respond to spikes in need – i.e. before negative coping strategies are employed - can deliver significant gains and should be prioritized.” ([USAID, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/LGRWAU43)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/MBXSCVWR?page=6&annotation=C47BGB9V))

“Even when receiving timely information on the ground, Members often had to wait for validation from national sources such as the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU) to make decisions, and the resources for anticipatory action were very limited.” ([Gualazzini, 2021, p. 4](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/BWDYDL8T)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/8U5XVU5K?page=4&annotation=CZST8S2L))

% takes long (25 days) is super resource intensive (key informant interviews -> 3 communities, 4 people each, lots of work.) + trust + triangulation + barely any automatization and rather coarse -> no detailed risk and vulnerability assessments (though this point may not be too valid.. -> the people know the area)

more and more severe droughts in Somalia

but Forecasts primarily global scale
thus far, AAs are often limited by data availability
reparation and water trucking as mayor actions/response -> detailed information necessary

“The handbook of drought indicators (Svoboda et al. 2016) lists more than 50 drought indices. Not a single one of these indices connects climate anomalies to socioeconomic vulnerabilities,” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1163](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=3&annotation=EDKZFHJX))
--> there were more indicators in the following year, but those were limited due to availibiltiy of socioeconomic data

"Stronger accountability: Data can communicate that work is being done and progress is happening. Data can enable greater transparency, which reduces inefficiency and corruption.
Attracting commitment and investments: Data can quantify problems and make it easier to communicate needs for political commitment and public and private investments.
Evidence-based decision-making: Data can inform policy- and decision-makers of where to focus efforts and which solutions are most effective, to ensure the greatest possible gains with existing resources.
Leaving no one behind: Disaggregated data can help identify specific groups or areas with unmet needs and higher levels of risk, to which interventions can be targeted."

“Experts in trigger methodology have indicated a more appropriate strategy may be to build on tools that currently exist at the government level such as national drought monitoring systems.

% thus nice in theory, but not useful in practice
% in regard to drought and water scarcity
% and while there is an extensive body of literature about these topics, the minor details are not of great interest to this work but the general conclusion, that physical, large scale drought or water scarcity indicators do not capture the required level of detail and impact that is needed to operationally act upon. Also, while the complexity of these concepts is due to the level of complexity of the surveyed phenomenon, its application and comparison is hindered. Thus a method to assess local impact, that builds and incorporates these concepts in a practically applicable manner is needed to adequately address this detrimental topic.

current challenges for utilisation of forecasting systems: scarse coverage of weather stations and poor utilisation by the farmers often due to bad dissemination channels  (too coarse, too unreliable)

“Community cultures, economies, and environments differ across countries and regions.

better understanding the forecasting and its implications on the ground are crucial. --> local information. tons of Volunteers but even more water sources. Continue with Crowdsensing? Implications?

understanding the full scope and knowing which water sources are at what level and quality can help with management decisions and trigger certain events very locally

“Thinking outside the box in terms of both hydro-meteorological and socio-economic indicators could be particularly useful” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 31](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=31&annotation=GNZJ3FR5))

% research aim - high level terms
The aim of this study is to adapt and apply an approach for community-based participatory mapping and monitoring of water sources in a water-scarce and resource-limited setting in collaboration with a national non-governmental organization to facilitate respective \acrlongpl{aa} in the context of \acrlong{fbf}, with the goal of improving water management and availability to address water shortages.

% fuuuuuuuuuuse
The aim of this study is therefore to incorporate local knowledge on the availability of water sources into the monitoring of drought impacts in an effort to support triggering and Anticipatory Actions under the Early Action Protocol. For this purpose, already proven methods are combined. First, semi-structured (expert-) interviews will be conducted to generate in-depth local knowledge. Based on these findings on local (pre-)conditions, needs and limitations, a monitoring tool based on a volunteersensing approach will then be conceptualized and subsequently discussed with local decision-makers. A prototype development based on the Social.Water tool is a further possibility. In addition, the question of the equality of local to scientific knowledge will be raised and further influences of such a contribution on social conditions will be investigated \todo{too much?}.


--> mapping -> refers to the entire initial phase - not only the geographical location but to the gathering of all key features of a water source.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Perhaps the most important part of your introduction is your questions and objectives, as it sets up the expectations for the rest of your thesis or dissertation. How you formulate your research questions and research objectives will depend on your discipline, topic, and focus, but you should always clearly state the central aim of your research.

% If your research aims to test hypotheses, you can formulate them here. Your introduction is also a good place for a conceptual framework that suggests relationships between variables.

“Firstly, there is a need for coordinated institutional responses in addressing matters related to water scarcity.” ([Leal Filho et al., 2022, p. 11](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/CBFHWKLP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/CG4XVTAI?page=11&annotation=PVHEGLHC))

“Secondly, it is important to correlate water availability – including groundwater – with an efficient water use to maximise and safeguard sustainable access for all users.” ([Leal Filho et al., 2022, p. 11](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/CBFHWKLP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/CG4XVTAI?page=11&annotation=RVPH3I3J))

“One of main challenges for adaptation for the coming decade is to extend planned adaptation at the local level and better integrate projected risk of climate change and variability into local autonomous responses.” ([Leal Filho et al., 2022, p. 11](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/CBFHWKLP)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/CG4XVTAI?page=11&annotation=K4DUGJBX))



overcome limitations / incorporating recommendations: e.g. increased support/engagement of poeple who actually use the reports (e.g. SRCS officials) 
fill geographic and information gap ->

its about drought forecasting and early trigger but at the same time highly local and practical information where and which water sources are good and functioning and which are not. -> highly practical information. Some data exist but (mostly) outdated.
about getting local knowledge from SRCS Volunteers and their community as well as returning information about the bigger picture
in order to enhance the quality of data for managing severe droughts in Somaliland. (one short paragraph -> motivation)
provide number of weather stations in the area


This work is thus based on the question \textit{"In what way can a collaborative Volunteer Sensing Approach be conceptualized to facilitate community water source monitoring in Somaliland in order to enhance early drought triggers and following Anticipatory Actions?"} and explores following hypotheses:
1. Local knowledge can enhance early drought impact triggers in the context of Anticipatory Actions in Somaliland.
2. Water source availability, accessibility and quality are feasible ecological and social indicators for monitoring early drought impacts and guide Anticipatory Actions in Somaliland.
3. The combination of qualitative interviews and Volunteered Crowdsensing is a promising approach to qualitatively and quantitatively monitor early drought impacts on communities in Somaliland.



% research objectives
1. To conduct a comprehensive review of existing literature and guidelines related to the design and implementation of \acrlong{cs} programmes, and identify relevant work in regard to the research aim and overall case study context. (of water scarcity and FbF)

2. To assess the feasibility of the \acrlong{cs} approach in the given context by identifying potential challenges and opportunities for successful implementation, and to propose recommendations for addressing these challenges.

3. if feasible, develop a replicable and adaptable framework for community-based participatory water source mapping and monitoring in the context of \acrlong{fbf}, based on the principles and recommendations identified in objectives 1 and 2.

4. To apply the adapted and developed frameworks in order to create a roadmap for the implementation of the proposed project, including specific products, actions, and stakeholders involved.

% research question
1. What specific guidelines and best practices exist for the design and implementation of community-based participatory water source mapping and monitoring programmes in resource-limited and water-scarce settings, and how can they be applied to the thematic direction of \acrlong{fbf}? % none -> wider angle -> FbF

2. Based on the identified frameworks and principles, how can a \acrlong{fbf} oriented, replicable and adaptable framework be developed for community-based participatory water source mapping and monitoring in the context of water-scarce and resource-limited settings? 

3. In the specific context of this case study, how can the developed framework be applied to create a tailored roadmap for the implementation of a community-based participatory water source mapping and monitoring project, including specific products, activities, and stakeholders involved in the project?
