\section{Proposal}
\# Overview
\#\# Motivation: Importance of Drought + local users

With the projection of rising frequency and intensity of droughts throughout vast parts of the African continent, measures for prediction, monitoring and evidence based anticipatory actions and management become ever more important \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,adelekanAfricaClimateChange2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

In order to meet this challenge, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement together with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center started the Forecast-based Financing (FbF) programme in 2007 to facilitate Anticipatory Actions instead of post-disaster reactions. Together with their local partners, the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is working on establishing so called Early Action Protocols (EAPs) to ensure better organization and coordination of Anticipatory Actions in the face of an incoming hazard. These actions are based on a predefined interplay of forecast, trigger and financing mechanisms to ensure rapid, scientific based responses.

Somaliland, being no exception to the above mentioned climatic trend, is characterized by droughts with far reaching impacts on ecological, economic, and social aspects. Defined by a semi-arid, four-season climate with two extensive dry seasons and an economic backbone of pastoralism and rain-fed agriculture, water accessibility is of key importance in Somaliland \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,petrucciLandscapeLandformsNorthern2022,republicofsomalilandSomalilandCountryProfile2021}.
In addition, the final report of the FbF feasibility study identifies five other hazards besides droughts, namely flood, cyclone, disease, locusts and conflict. Of all these hazards, drought was ranked as the greatest threat due to its increasing frequency, severity and wide-ranging consequences.\newline

Existing drought forecasts and trigger indicators are mostly based on physical indicators and cover especially macro- and international levels, e.g. EDDI, SPI, SPEI \todo{look them up + which forecast is defined by the SRCS?}. Fine grained up-to-date forecasts which not only include physical but also social circumstances and knowledge on local levels are often scarce or even non-existent \todo[fancyline]{sources}. "However, assessments focused only on physical variables and processes fail to capture why drought matters [...]."\autocite[3]{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}, how it impacts communities and which mitigation strategies are locally taken \todo{source?}.\newline

Besides the further development of more fine grained technical solutions the integration of local knowledge is another way forward. Engaging local people and communities and giving them an active voice in defining and co-producing anticipatory actions and knowledge can be of multiple benefit to communities and enrich the data generated \autocite{somaliredcrescentsocietyFeasibilityStudyPotential2022, njambi-szlapkaIntegratingCommunityVoices}\todo{source}. On the one hand, citizens can help to fill data gaps of categorized measurements such as simple assessments of dry-to-wet conditions which correspond to the above mentioned technical drought indicators \autocite{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}. On the other hand, citizens can contribute their local knowledge which can potentially draw on years of experience, encompass a wide range of aspects and give them a feeling of co-owning which in itself can already bring many advantages \autocite{njambi-szlapkaIntegratingCommunityVoices}\todo{source}. The IFRC states, that the "community engagement and accountability (CEA) is essential […] to build acceptance and trust” \autocite{ifrcCommunityEngagementAccountability}(IFRC n.d.) for effective and sustainable outcomes. 
Nonetheless, direct contributions and communication from and with volunteers or community members remain a challenge in the joint management of hazards and risks. The tasks are numerous and need to take into consideration different aspects, ranging from cultural differences to different background knowledge and technical capabilities and capacities.

Qualitative interviews can capture a wide range of local contribution, knowledge and information but are very labour intensive, often limited in time and hence not feasible on larger scale for monitoring purposes. Providing a technical solution that enables mutual contact between communities and the Somalia Red Crescent Society (SRCS) in a simple and accessible way would make it possible to collect this most helpful information. By ensuring that sovereignty over the collected data rests with the community, the decision-making power and benefits remain with those concerned. Therefore, in the development and application of an Early Action Protocol (EAP) in the context of Forecast based Action (FbA) in Somalia, the technical aspect in particular holds great potential to benefit numerous communities over the long term.

While there is a comparatively good basis with regard to the general availability of data on social, economic and natural information and conditions, as well as their spatial and qualitative characteristics, the timeliness of this information varies greatly. Especially in the context of Anticipatory Action, time is of the essence and a swift action based on up-to-date data is crucial. Gathering and incorporating local knowledge through manual surveys by a central organisation can be of great value, as shown above, but is time-consuming and slow.

The benefits of overcoming the high labour costs and the temporal handicap by providing a simple and accessible tool for the SRCS’s large network of volunteers can already be seen in other comparable contexts using the Community Based Surveillance (CBS) programme, its successor NYSS, the Ushahidi platform or tools like Social.Water, ITIKI and CoCoRaHS \autocite{fienenSocialWaterCrowdsourcing2012a} \todo{sources}. The CBS is a pioneering technical approach to disease outbreak surveillance in Somalia and was developed as part of the SRCS Health Strategy 2019-2023. In this process, “volunteers report health risks through their respective locations and send to the SRCS data platform […]” \autocite[57]{somaliredcrescentsocietyFeasibilityStudyPotential2022} through coded SMS. So far, 315 volunteers from 115 villages have specifically been trained. In at least two cases, an outbreak could be contained thanks to early detection (SRCS 2021, 2022). On top of this already proven application, further functions could be added as needed.
Social.Water, ITIKI and CoCoRaHS are environmental data collection and drought monitoring implementations. These approaches are based on Crowdsensing approaches and partly employ more sophisticated technical solutions via internet connections, wireless sensor networks or photographs and have been implemented and tested in recent studies or ongoing monitoring programmes. While suggesting that the method of Crowdsensing for data collection and monitoring is fit for purpose, these approaches are not feasible to this context due to internet connection and technical equipment requirements, lack of categorization or their focus on just environmental data acquisition without taking sufficient account of the impact on the community impact and social realities.

The aim of this study is therefore to incorporate local knowledge on the availability of water sources into the monitoring of drought impacts in an effort to support triggering and Anticipatory Actions under the Early Action Protocol. For this purpose, already proven methods are combined. First, semi-structured (expert-) interviews will be conducted to generate in-depth local knowledge. Based on these findings on local (pre-)conditions, needs and limitations, a monitoring tool based on a volunteersensing approach will then be conceptualized and subsequently discussed with local decision-makers. A prototype development based on the Social.Water tool is a further possibility. In addition, the question of the equality of local to scientific knowledge will be raised and further influences of such a contribution on social conditions will be investigated \todo{too much?}.
This work is thus based on the question \textit{"In what way can a collaborative Volunteer Sensing Approach be conceptualized to facilitate community water source monitoring in Somaliland in order to enhance early drought triggers and following Anticipatory Actions?"} and explores following hypotheses:
1. Local knowledge can enhance early drought impact triggers in the context of Anticipatory Actions in Somaliland.
2. Water source availability, accessibility and quality are feasible ecological and social indicators for monitoring early drought impacts and guide Anticipatory Actions in Somaliland.
3. The combination of qualitative interviews and Volunteered Crowdsensing is a promising approach to qualitatively and quantitatively monitor early drought impacts on communities in Somaliland.

“Involving stakeholders in the co-creation of WS assessment tools [38] could help increase the legitimacy and salience of data. Local knowledge should be incorporated into citizen science strategies: people are sources of information but they also generate a common understanding of water dynamics in the context of the socio-ecological processes involved. Co-creation will facilitate the communication of WS data in a harmonised and aggregated way that improves decision making based on real scenarios with actively involved and engaged stakeholders [13,22,91,108].” ([Butte et al., 2022, p. 10](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/QB97YZ2M)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/Q936I2JN?page=10&annotation=JNYCQVSA))

whatever source of water they can find is what they have. (2023-03-04_Beledi, Pos. 20)

citizen science in the field of water monitoring: rivers, lakes, groundwater but hardly ever any direct drinking sources for early actions
for the first part: compare introduction of: “Citizen science projects in freshwater monitoring. From individual design to clusters?” ([Kirschke et al., 2022, p. 1](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/GPC3LDT5)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/AI7HRQYC?page=1&annotation=6IJERY2C))

"Stronger accountability: Data can communicate that work is being done and progress is happening. Data can enable greater transparency, which reduces inefficiency and corruption.
Attracting commitment and investments: Data can quantify problems and make it easier to communicate needs for political commitment and public and private investments.
Evidence-based decision-making: Data can inform policy- and decision-makers of where to focus efforts and which solutions are most effective, to ensure the greatest possible gains with existing resources.

“Experts in trigger methodology have indicated a more appropriate strategy may be to build on tools that currently exist at the government level such as national drought monitoring systems. As such, the ideal is an iterative process with the ground level along with a technology push that creates new ways to analyse drought and drought risk.” ([RCRC, 2020, p. 28](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/UESIQTRJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/P5JPVZ97?page=28&annotation=977VS8FC))

current challenges for utilisation of forecasting systems: scarse coverage of weather stations and poor utilisation by the farmers often due to bad dissemination channels  (too coarse, too unreliable)

“Spotlight on Somalia: Can we learn from failure? In Somalia in 2011, a famine was declared that, along with the complexity of the conflict situation, was responsible for thousands of deaths. At its peak, almost 4 in every 10 children in Southern Somalia were acutely malnourished, and 4 million people were estimated to be without basic food. The horror of this tragedy has since haunted the international community, who received 11 months of early warnings before a famine was declared. Beginning with La Nina forecasts almost one year in advance, FEWS-NET and others provided briefing notes and warning information to humanitarian actors in the region. Several months later, these alerts explained that rainy seasons had already failed, and that major impacts were extremely likely (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012). There has been a great deal of analysis of this event, in which several conclusions have come to light. One is that funding needs to be more readily available based on forecasted information (Lautze et al. 2012). The below graph (Hillbruner and Moloney 2012) demonstrates how large-scale funding was mobilized in the aftermath of the famine declaration, and was ultimately available after the most vulnerable had died. Secondly, the humanitarian community needs to clearly take responsibility for acting in advance of a disaster, even in complex cases like the Somali context. At the moment, such organizations are not held accountable for failure to act on early warning, as disaster response is considered business-asusual. Shouldering the responsibility to act in this critical moment between a warning and a disaster could avoid such impacts in the future (Lautze et al. 2012).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/WKFPUZCW?page=7&annotation=LIY2ABLI))

in order to enhance the quality of data for managing severe droughts in Somaliland. (one short paragraph -> motivation)
provide number of weather stations in the area

--> problem: conclusion of existing sources, tools and forecasts - only macro/international level? or are there meso/micro forecasts available?
better understanding the forecasting and its implications on the ground are crucial. --> local information. tons of Volunteers but even more water sources. Continue with Crowdsensing? Implications?

--> highlight the pro of this work
"The highly localized information provided by observers can fill drought monitoring gaps by ground-truthing quantitative indicators and offering information in places where other monitoring tools may not exist. Overall, the research team found that strategic investments in time and funding can help fill in geographic and temporal gaps in drought monitoring information through volunteer observations."

“Citizen science programmes are promising cost-efficient methods to monitor environmental resources, which make them especially suitable for low-income countries to overcome their sparse data resolution.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1598](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=9&annotation=4E9JCTQ5))
“Since today's citizen science studies are mostly located in high-income countries, we are enthusiastic to motivate the scientific community to conduct citizen science studies in low-income countries.” ([Weeser et al., 2018, p. 1598](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/SFA2MLHC)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/GP79FHFC?page=9&annotation=TYD7Q2ZD))

\section{Questions and objectivese}
expectations, central aim, framework
% Perhaps the most important part of your introduction is your questions and objectives, as it sets up the expectations for the rest of your thesis or dissertation. How you formulate your research questions and research objectives will depend on your discipline, topic, and focus, but you should always clearly state the central aim of your research.

% If your research aims to test hypotheses, you can formulate them here. Your introduction is also a good place for a conceptual framework that suggests relationships between variables.
