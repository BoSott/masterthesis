what drought is (definition)
drought monitoring but not only physical indicators but socials as well (water source accessibility) “However, assessments focused only on physical variables and processes fail to capture why drought matters, in other words, how social, economic, and ecological systems are affected (i.e., impacts) (Redmond 2002; Van Loon et al. 2016; Wilhite and Glantz 1985).” ([Lackstrom et al., 2022, p. 3](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/YI366LQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3JTQ72UN?page=3\&annotation=72WYIE7B))
current monitoring approaches e.g. (“the extent to which volunteers’ assessments of dry-to-wet conditions correspond to objective drought indicators (EDDI, SPI, SPEI) typically employed for monitoring drought” ([Lackstrom et al., 2022, p. 2](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/YI366LQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3JTQ72UN?page=2\&annotation=DQ4ZNIRS)))
“quantitative indicators (namely the SPEI, SPI, and EDDI).” ([Lackstrom et al., 2022, p. 26](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/YI366LQY)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/3JTQ72UN?page=26\&annotation=G4KIJYUR))

--> highlight the pro of this work
"The highly localized information provided by observers can fill drought monitoring gaps by ground-truthing quantitative indicators and offering information in places where other monitoring tools may not exist. Overall, the research team found that strategic investments in time and funding can help fill in geographic and temporal gaps in drought monitoring information through volunteer observations."

key aims and objectives + research questions

incorporating local knowledge? - if yes, how?
how to account for gender inequalities? Even possible?

current challenges for utilisation of forecasting systems: scarse coverage of weather stations and poor utilisation by the farmers often due to bad dissemination channels  (too coarse, too unreliable)

provide hypothesis - 'integration' of local stakeholders/volunteers into drought and water source monitoring can help to get a better picture for early drought impact assessment and thus better and faster management and reactions
+ local people are engaged with the process and come into contact with 'scientific' knowledge/forecasts 
+ equal inclusion of local / indigenous knowledge and scientific forecasts can enhance the quality and make it more relevant on smaller scales (meso/mikro/local level)

\section{Introduction}
\# Overview
\#\# Motivation: Importance of Drought + local users

With the projection of rising frequency and intensity of droughts throughout vast parts of the African continent, measures for prediction, monitoring and evidence based anticipatory actions and management become ever more important \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,adelekanAfricaClimateChange2022,vereintenationenSpecialReportDrought2021}.

In order to meet this challenge, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement together with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center started the Forecast-based Financing (FbF) programme in 2007 to facilitate Anticipatory Actions instead of post-disaster reactions. Together with their local partners, the International Federation of Red Cross Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is working on establishing so called Early Action Protocols (EAPs) to ensure better organization and coordination of Anticipatory Actions in the face of an incoming hazard. These actions are based on a predefined interplay of forecast, trigger and financing mechanisms to ensure rapid, scientific based responses.

Somaliland, being no exception to the above mentioned climatic trend, is characterized by droughts with far reaching impacts on ecological, economic, and social aspects. Defined by a semi-arid, four-season climate with two extensive dry seasons and an economic backbone of pastoralism and rain-fed agriculture, water accessibility is of key importance in Somaliland \autocite{abdulkadirAssessmentDroughtRecurrence2017,petrucciLandscapeLandformsNorthern2022,republicofsomalilandSomalilandCountryProfile2021}.
In addition, the final report of the FbF feasibility study identifies five other hazards besides droughts, namely flood, cyclone, disease, locusts and conflict. Of all these hazards, drought was ranked as the greatest threat due to its increasing frequency, severity and wide-ranging consequences.\newline

Existing drought forecasts and trigger indicators are mostly based on physical indicators and cover especially macro- and international levels, e.g. EDDI, SPI, SPEI \todo{look them up + which forecast is defined by the SRCS?}. Fine grained up-to-date forecasts which not only include physical but also social circumstances and knowledge on local levels are often scarce or even non-existent \todo[fancyline]{sources}. "However, assessments focused only on physical variables and processes fail to capture why drought matters [...]."\autocite[3]{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}, how it impacts communities and which mitigation strategies are locally taken \todo{source?}.\newline

Besides the further development of more fine grained technical solutions the integration of local knowledge is another way forward. Engaging local people and communities and giving them an active voice in defining and co-producing anticipatory actions and knowledge can be of multiple benefit to communities and enrich the data generated \autocite{somaliredcrescentsocietyFeasibilityStudyPotential2022, njambi-szlapkaIntegratingCommunityVoices}\todo{source}. On the one hand, citizens can help to fill data gaps of categorized measurements such as simple assessments of dry-to-wet conditions which correspond to the above mentioned technical drought indicators \autocite{lackstromBackyardHydroclimatologyCitizen2022}. On the other hand, citizens can contribute their local knowledge which can potentially draw on years of experience, encompass a wide range of aspects and give them a feeling of co-owning which in itself can already bring many advantages \autocite{njambi-szlapkaIntegratingCommunityVoices}\todo{source}. The IFRC states, that the "community engagement and accountability (CEA) is essential […] to build acceptance and trust” \autocite{ifrcCommunityEngagementAccountability}(IFRC n.d.) for effective and sustainable outcomes. 
Nonetheless, direct contributions and communication from and with volunteers or community members remain a challenge in the joint management of hazards and risks. The tasks are numerous and need to take into consideration different aspects, ranging from cultural differences to different background knowledge and technical capabilities and capacities.

Qualitative interviews can capture a wide range of local contribution, knowledge and information but are very labour intensive, often limited in time and hence not feasible on larger scale for monitoring purposes. Providing a technical solution that enables mutual contact between communities and the Somalia Red Crescent Society (SRCS) in a simple and accessible way would make it possible to collect this most helpful information. By ensuring that sovereignty over the collected data rests with the community, the decision-making power and benefits remain with those concerned. Therefore, in the development and application of an Early Action Protocol (EAP) in the context of Forecast based Action (FbA) in Somalia, the technical aspect in particular holds great potential to benefit numerous communities over the long term.

While there is a comparatively good basis with regard to the general availability of data on social, economic and natural information and conditions, as well as their spatial and qualitative characteristics, the timeliness of this information varies greatly. Especially in the context of Anticipatory Action, time is of the essence and a swift action based on up-to-date data is crucial. Gathering and incorporating local knowledge through manual surveys by a central organisation can be of great value, as shown above, but is time-consuming and slow.

The benefits of overcoming the high labour costs and the temporal handicap by providing a simple and accessible tool for the SRCS’s large network of volunteers can already be seen in other comparable contexts using the Community Based Surveillance (CBS) programme, its successor NYSS, the Ushahidi platform or tools like Social.Water, ITIKI and CoCoRaHS \autocite{fienenSocialWaterCrowdsourcing2012a} \todo{sources}. The CBS is a pioneering technical approach to disease outbreak surveillance in Somalia and was developed as part of the SRCS Health Strategy 2019-2023. In this process, “volunteers report health risks through their respective locations and send to the SRCS data platform […]” \autocite[57]{somaliredcrescentsocietyFeasibilityStudyPotential2022} through coded SMS. So far, 315 volunteers from 115 villages have specifically been trained. In at least two cases, an outbreak could be contained thanks to early detection (SRCS 2021, 2022). On top of this already proven application, further functions could be added as needed.
Social.Water, ITIKI and CoCoRaHS are environmental data collection and drought monitoring implementations. These approaches are based on Crowdsensing approaches and partly employ more sophisticated technical solutions via internet connections, wireless sensor networks or photographs and have been implemented and tested in recent studies or ongoing monitoring programmes. While suggesting that the method of Crowdsensing for data collection and monitoring is fit for purpose, these approaches are not feasible to this context due to internet connection and technical equipment requirements, lack of categorization or their focus on just environmental data acquisition without taking sufficient account of the impact on the community impact and social realities.

The aim of this study is therefore to incorporate local knowledge on the availability of water sources into the monitoring of drought impacts in an effort to support triggering and Anticipatory Actions under the Early Action Protocol. For this purpose, already proven methods are combined. First, semi-structured (expert-) interviews will be conducted to generate in-depth local knowledge. Based on these findings on local (pre-)conditions, needs and limitations, a monitoring tool based on a volunteersensing approach will then be conceptualized and subsequently discussed with local decision-makers. A prototype development based on the Social.Water tool is a further possibility. In addition, the question of the equality of local to scientific knowledge will be raised and further influences of such a contribution on social conditions will be investigated \todo{too much?}.
This work is thus based on the question \textit{"In what way can a collaborative Volunteer Sensing Approach be conceptualized to facilitate community water source monitoring in Somaliland in order to enhance early drought triggers and following Anticipatory Actions?"} and explores following hypotheses:
1. Local knowledge can enhance early drought impact triggers in the context of Anticipatory Actions in Somaliland.
2. Water source availability, accessibility and quality are feasible ecological and social indicators for monitoring early drought impacts and guide Anticipatory Actions in Somaliland.
3. The combination of qualitative interviews and Volunteered Crowdsensing is a promising approach to qualitatively and quantitatively monitor early drought impacts on communities in Somaliland.

Why predict climate hazards if we need to understand impacts? Putting humans back into the drought equation

“There has been little effort to align the spatiotemporal granularity of socioeconomic assessments with the granularity of weather or climate monitoring.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1161](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=1&annotation=QBTLFCXM))
“we highlight the need to collect and analyze environmental and socioeconomic data together and discuss novel strategies for coordinated data collection via mobile technologies from a drought risk management perspective.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1161](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=1&annotation=9BUBHWNB))

“but questions related to coping capacities, migration, poverty, water supply, access to food and markets, or political conflict remain unanswered or are even decoupled from routine drought risk assessments” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1162](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=2&annotation=HE48ZWFA))

“The handbook of drought indicators (Svoboda et al. 2016) lists more than 50 drought indices. Not a single one of these indices connects climate anomalies to socioeconomic vulnerabilities,” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1163](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=3&annotation=EDKZFHJX))
--> there were more indicators in the following year, but those were limited due to availibiltiy of socioeconomic data

“In a region where migration is one of the main coping mechanisms for drought, a targeted survey focusing on the early detection of migration movements would help mobilize the timely allocation of resources by humanitarian decision-makers or even the mitigation of drought impacts.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1167](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=7&annotation=N9FRDA9C))

+ humanitarian workers could focus on response rather than data acquisition (my idea)

“In addition, the impact of agricultural conditions that are not necessarily related to climate shocks, but to other factors such as pests or social conflict, could easily be monitored and used to issue early warnings and raise emergency funds before any kind of impact on crops or socioeconomic conditions is visible.” ([Enenkel et al., 2020, p. 1168](zotero://select/groups/4773535/items/RX575C79)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/groups/4773535/items/XD499UNK?page=8&annotation=MDXAXIJY))

Statement of objectives. Clearly and concisely, what are the general goals of the
thesis. Each thesis may have distinct goals. For instance, is your thesis project purely
descriptive of a new phenomena? Is it empirically testing causal relationships
between particular variables of interest? Adocumentclassre your providing a critical evaluation of a
particular topic or framework? Are you providing a new perspective by presenting a
new typology? Are you creating, implementing, or testing a new research tool? Any
such missions of the thesis should be clearly stated in this section.
• Significance of the project. What is the social importance of this thesis. That is, how
will this thesis aid our collective understanding of emerging media, in terms of
theory and real-world application to a particular social domain (e.g., politics, health,
entertainment, design).




The practical implementation will be based on a database and the integration of communication possibilities but could be further extended by creating visualisation and information capabilities such as a web map. On the other hand, the ability not only to receive messages but also to send messages or information to volunteers based on certain criteria, e.g. their location, could be a useful feature in the context of the uses mentioned above. Other possibilities for analysis or planning purposes, such as calculating accessibility by integrating Openrouteservice (ORS) functionality, could be future enhancements.
